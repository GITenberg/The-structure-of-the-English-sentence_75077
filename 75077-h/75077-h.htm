<hr class="r5">

<p><span class="smcap large">It</span> has long seemed to me both unfortunate and wrong
that many pupils leave school with no keen delight in the
study of English grammar, and with the mistaken idea
that it is mainly a study of rules and definitions based
upon the forms of mere words. Far from this, it should
be from the beginning a study of thought. Words should
be examined solely from the point of view of their function
in the sentence, the part they play in the communication
of thought. Always the sentence should be the
unit of study, and it should be looked at, not primarily as
expressing a thought that was once in the mind of its
author, but rather as forever communicating thought to
the minds of its readers. For men would neither speak
nor write without an audience. Their aim is not to get
their thought into words for satisfaction to themselves,
but to convey thought by means of words to their fellow-men.
Therefore it is that in all language study, in all
language teaching, the governing idea should be, not expression,
but communication, of thought.</p>

<p>It is now universally conceded that the purposes of
grammar study are three; namely, and in the order of
their importance and their realization,—1. to discipline
the mind; 2. to aid in the interpretation of speech and
literature; 3. to facilitate the correct expression of
thought. It cannot, then, be denied that a rational investigation
of the structure of English sentences is far<span class="pagenum" id="Page_iv">[Pg iv]</span>
more important than any other phase of grammar study,
and for three reasons:—1. it is a study of thought, and
as such must discipline the mind; 2. it trains the student
through practice, which is the most effective way, to interpret
the thought of others; 3. by presenting to him
the best models for imitation, it aids him in communicating
clearly his own thoughts.</p>

<p>Believing this, and knowing from much experience that
not until students have examined the structure of sentences
in relation to the thought embodied, do they have
any vital or useful knowledge of etymology and syntax,
I have long thought that a book was needed which should
deal only with the analysis of sentences, the culminating
phase of grammar study, for which all previous work is a
preparation. The book that I have prepared is not intended
to supplant any text-book in grammar, but rather
to provide for a profitable continuation of grammar study
in high schools and normal schools. It is based
upon the English sentence as it has been written during
the present century. No attempt has been made to criticize
any form or variation of sentence structure. Instead,
sentences are examined as they have been constructed by
reputable authors, with a view to determining the adequacy
of their structure to the communication of thought.</p>

<p>My highest aim and my sincerest hope have been to
present worthy matter in such a way as to require and
stimulate good thinking on the part of students, and to
make them marvel and rejoice at the perfect adaptability
of the English sentence to the noble burden that it bears,
that of communicating thought.</p>

<p class="c sp xlarge" id="c1">THE<br>
STRUCTURE OF THE ENGLISH SENTENCE</p>

<hr class="r65">

<h2>CHAPTER I</h2>

<p class="c sp">THE PROPOSITION</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> the mind of every human being there are innumerable
ideas, or mental pictures, gathered from previous experience.
Whenever we perceive a relation between any
two of these ideas, we form a judgment, or, in other
words, have a thought. If we wish to communicate our
thought we ordinarily express it in words, and this verbal
expression of a thought we call a sentence.</p>

<p>For example, I have an idea of <i>children</i> and an idea of
the activity called <i>play</i>; I see a relation between them,
that of agent and thing done; I affirm this relation, and
have the sentence, <i>Children play</i>. Or I detect a relation
between <i>flower</i> and <i>whiteness</i>, and say, <i>The flower is
white</i>. Or I fail to establish such a relation and so deny
the former statement by saying, <i>The flower is not white</i>.
In each case my sentence serves the great purpose of communicating
thought; and it does this by calling up in the
mind of the reader the same combination of ideas that
exists in my mind.</p>

<p>Another name for sentences like those just formed, is
<i>proposition</i>, a proposition being the expression of one
thought. But since a proposition is the statement of a
judgment, it must contain two ideas. One of these, denoting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</span>
that of which something is asserted, we call the
<i>subject</i>; the other, denoting what is said of the subject,
we call the <i>predicate</i>. The relation between these two
ideas cannot always be expressed by means of two words.
If we wish to assert a relation between <i>water</i> and <i>freshness</i>,
we must use at least three words, <i>Water is fresh</i>;
the word <i>is</i> contains little, if any, meaning, but is necessary
for the grammatical expression of the thought.</p>

<p>Although a proposition must contain at least two ideas,
it may contain any number of them. For example, I
may expand the proposition, <i>Children play</i>, by additional
ideas, telling (1) whose children, (2) a characteristic
of the children, (3) what they play, (4) where they
play, (5) when they play,—<i>My neighbor’s little children
play hide and seek in their yard every evening</i>.
Still I have only one proposition, for the number of
propositions in a sentence depends on the number of
judgments, or thoughts, expressed,—in other words, on
the number of assertions made; and here there is but one,
that made essentially by the verb <i>play</i>.</p>

<p>All sentences, however, are not single propositions, for
in building sentences we often go a step further than
seeing the relation between ideas, that is, we see the
relation between thoughts; and so, instead of combining
mere words, we combine whole propositions into one
sentence. Take, for example, the two propositions,
<i>Children play</i>, and <i>Children enjoy play</i>. I may see
that the second fact is a cause of the first, and, by
combining the two so as to bring out this relation of
cause and effect, get the sentence, <i>Children play because
they enjoy it</i>, wherein I substitute the pronouns they
and it for the already known words <i>children</i> and <i>play</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</span></p>

<p>Or take the two propositions, <i>The lion roared</i>, and
<i>The hyena laughed</i>. I may wish to tell some one
that these two actions were related in time, occurring
simultaneously; I do this by saying, <i>The lion roared
and the hyena laughed</i>, where I have one sentence,
but made of two propositions, because conveying two
thoughts. I might put in other thoughts, telling (1)
which lion, (2) why he roared, (3) how long the hyena
laughed,—The lion <i>that was kept in the cage near the
door</i> roared <i>because the keeper did not bring his food</i>,
and the hyena laughed <i>till he had set all the animals
around him in an uproar</i>. Here I have one sentence
containing five thoughts, therefore made up of five
propositions.</p>

<p>However, it is not with composition, the building up
of sentences, that we are to concern ourselves, so much
as with an examination into the structure of the finished
product. Now, when we study the structure of the human
body, we look upon it first as a symmetrical whole, then
we separate it into its largest, most distinct members,—the
head, the trunk, the arms, the legs. After we have
noted the relations of these parts, we take up each part
as a whole and proceed again in the same way. In
analyzing sentences we shall pursue the same method.</p>

<p>Every sentence is a unit just as the body is; like the
body, too, it is made up of smaller units. In studying
its structure we should first of all find the units which
compose the sentence-unit. If the sentence is a single
proposition, the constituent units are, of course, the subject
and the predicate. But if the sentence is a combination
of propositions, as is oftener the case, then its chief
units are these propositions. Therefore, as a foundation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</span>
for the analysis of sentences, we must be able to determine
readily how many propositions a given sentence contains.
Our first exercise will be devoted to this end.</p>


<p class="c p1">Exercise 1</p>

<p>Resolve the following sentences into single propositions.
Remember that the number of propositions depends
on the number of assertions made.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE CLASSIFICATION OF PROPOSITIONS</p>


<p><b>How Propositions differ in Nature.</b>—In studying the
human body we cannot help seeing that all the prominent
members are not equally important. Some could
exist independently of others, while some are joined
directly to a more important part, and, if separated from
it, would have no use or life. So, in studying a sentence,
we notice that all the propositions are not equal in rank.
Some are complete sentences in themselves; others would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</span>
not make sense if they were obliged to stand alone.
Hence there arise two classes of propositions,—<i>principal</i>
and <i>subordinate</i>, or <i>independent</i> and <i>dependent.</i></p>

<p>In every sentence there is at least one primary thought
which it is the author’s main purpose to communicate,
and this will always be found in the principal proposition.
There may be modifying circumstances of time,
place, manner, condition, etc., which he wishes to embody
in his sentence, but he brings these in by means
of words and phrases, which are elements of the principal
proposition, or else, if the language affords no
adequate words and phrases, by means of subordinate
propositions.</p>

<p>In the following sentence from Carlyle,—“How
true is that old fable of the Sphinx, who sat by the
wayside propounding her riddle to the passengers,” there
are plainly two propositions. It is also plain that the
thought which the author wished most to convey is this,—The
old fable of the Sphinx is true. In fact, it was
the prime importance of this thought that led him to put
it in the principal proposition. He chose to add the
thought expressed in the second proposition, but he
showed its minor importance by constructing the proposition
so that it serves as a mere modifier of the word
<i>Sphinx</i>. From a grammatical point of view the first
proposition is complete,—it could stand alone and make
sense; hence it is called <i>independent</i>. On the other hand,
the second proposition, if separated from the first, would
lose its meaning; it is therefore said to be dependent.</p>

<p>Consider these sentences:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. The Mohawk hardly feels the scalping-knife while he
shouts his death song.—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>2. No success is worthy of the name unless it is won by
honest industry and a brave breasting of the waves of fortune.—<i>Huxley.</i></p>

<p>3. That country is the fairest which is inhabited by the
noblest minds.—<i>Emerson.</i></p>
</div>

<p>If we separate each of these sentences into its two
propositions and apply the test,—<i>which proposition is
by itself grammatically complete?</i> we shall see that the
first proposition in each sentence is independent and the
second dependent. But it may be said that in each case
the dependent proposition is necessary for the truth of
the sentence, that its thought must have been in the
author’s mind not as an addition to the main thought
but as something indispensable. This is perfectly true;
logically the truth of the independent proposition does
depend on the thought in the dependent proposition, but
grammatically the dependence is the other way. Notice
that in each of these sentences the second proposition
denotes a modifying circumstance of the main thought,
and therefore takes rank in the sentence merely as an
idea,—telling in the first sentence <i>when</i> the Mohawk
hardly feels the scalping knife, in the second <i>under what
condition</i> success is unworthy, in the third <i>which</i> country
is the fairest. Now, had the author so chosen, these
modifications might all have been expressed by phrases,
though possibly not so clearly.</p>



<p><b>Tests for Independent and Dependent Propositions.</b>—From
the foregoing we may deduce the following tests
for propositions.</p>

<p>1. For the independent proposition.—(<i>a</i>) It contains
the main thought that the author wished to convey. (<i>b</i>)<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</span>
It is so expressed that it is grammatically complete when
standing alone.</p>

<p>2. For the dependent proposition.—(<i>a</i>) It expresses
a modifying thought of some word or words in the independent
proposition. (<i>b</i>) It may be changed to a simpler
element, a word or phrase, provided there is a word
or phrase in the language to express the same meaning.
(<i>c</i>) It is not so expressed that it would make sense standing
alone.</p>



<p><b>Function of the Dependent Proposition.</b>—From what
has already been said it may be inferred that the dependent
proposition is employed (1) for variety, in the
place of a word or phrase, (2) for the adequate expression
of what we have no word or phrase capable of
saying. But this is not all. Every dependent proposition
can be changed into an independent proposition,
and so might have been brought into the sentence in that
form. For example,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The Mohawk shouts his death song, and he hardly feels the
scalping knife.</p>

<p>That country is inhabited by the noblest minds and it is the
fairest.</p>

<p>Success should be won by honest industry and a brave breasting
of the waves of fortune, and no other success is worthy of
the name.</p>
</div>

<p>By comparing these recasted sentences with the originals
we perceive why the authors employed the dependent
proposition; by means of it they have shown what the
recasted sentences do not show—(1) what is the main
thought and what is subordinate; (2) the special relation
existing between the principal and the subordinate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</span>
thought. This second point is very important. If we
had to tell a story in sentences of one proposition each,
how difficult it would be to give the reader an idea of
the various relations between these propositions. Besides,
how tedious is a succession of single propositions.
Compare, for instance, the following six sentences with
the one smooth, compact, clear sentence into which they
may be combined.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The jay hoards up nuts for winter use.<br>

This is a general belief among country people.<br>

This belief has probably some foundation in fact.<br>

Where can the jay safely place his stores?<br>

One is at a loss to know this.<br>

His stores are apt to be pilfered by the mice and squirrels.<br>

The general belief among country people that the jay hoards
up nuts for winter use has probably some foundation in fact,
though one is at a loss to know where he could place his stores
so that they would not be pilfered by the mice and squirrels.—<i>Burroughs.</i></p>
</div>



<p><b>The Combination of Independent Propositions.</b>—This
comes about when we wish to put related thoughts into
one sentence in such a way as to show that they are
equally important, and that, although they are related,
neither is to be considered as denoting some modifying
circumstance of any idea in the other. For example,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>1. There must be work done by the arms or none of us could
live.—<i>Ruskin.</i></p>

<p>2. Misfortune could not subdue him and prosperity could not
spoil him.—<i>Dickens.</i></p>

<p>3. You may talk of the tyranny of Nero and Tiberius; but
the real tyranny is the tyranny of your next door neighbor.—<i>Bagehot.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</span></p>

<p>Notice that the connectives in these sentences, while indicating
a relation between the propositions as wholes,
belong to one proposition no more than to the other,
hence are not a grammatical part of either; also that
neither proposition is a modifier of any idea in the other.</p>

<p>It has been well said that often when we combine two
independent propositions into one sentence, we are really
conveying three thoughts,—the thought in each proposition
and the thought suggested by the relation between
the two propositions. In sentence 3 just quoted,
we have not only the two propositions expressed, but two
more implied; viz., <i>the tyranny of Nero and Tiberius is
not the real tyranny</i>; and, <i>the real tyranny is not talked
about</i>.</p>

<p>We are now ready to take the second step in studying
the structure of a given sentence, that is, to determine
whether its component propositions are independent or
dependent.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE CLASSIFICATION OF SENTENCES ACCORDING TO<br>
STRUCTURE</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">We</span> have seen that a sentence may consist of one proposition
or of several, and that all its propositions may be
independent or one or more of them may be dependent.
This freedom of combination gives rise to three distinct
types of sentences, classified according to the number
and the kind of propositions they contain. These are
<i>simple</i>, <i>complex</i>, and <i>compound</i>.</p>

<p>1. <i>A simple sentence</i> is one that consists of one independent
proposition.—“Lightness of touch is the
crowning test of power.”—<i>Higginson.</i></p>

<p>2. <i>A complex sentence</i> is one that contains at least one
dependent proposition. It usually contains a complete
independent proposition also, and it may contain any
number of dependent propositions.</p>

<p>(a) With the independent proposition complete,—“What
inspiration gilds his features as he descends the
mount with the Tables in his hand.”—<i>Lord.</i></p>

<p>(b) With the independent proposition incomplete because
the dependent proposition is its subject.—“That
Chaucer, being at Milan, should not have found occasion
to ride across so far as Padua for the sake of seeing the
most famous literary man of the day, is incredible.”—<i>Lowell.</i></p>

<p>3. <i>A compound sentence</i> is one that contains at least
two independent propositions. It may also contain one
or more dependent propositions. In that case it is often
called <i>complex-compound</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</span></p>

<p>(a) Compound sentence,—“It is a strange tale, but
it hath the recommendation of brevity.”—<i>Jerrold.</i></p>

<p>(b) Complex-compound.—“Times of heroism are
generally times of terror, but the day never shines in
which this element may not work.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>



<p><b>Difficulty in Classifying Sentences.</b>—It is sometimes
difficult for a beginner to determine whether a sentence
is complex or compound, that is, whether a certain one
of its propositions is independent or dependent. Take,
for instance, two such sentences as the following: “The
ground is wet this morning because it rained last night”;
and, “The ground is wet this morning, hence it rained
last night.” Out of each of these expressions we get a
statement of cause and effect, but the two sentences are
not therefore alike, for a sentence is to be considered not
only logically but grammatically, before we can decide
what kind it is. It is clear that in each sentence the first
proposition is independent, so we shall examine only the
second.</p>

<p>Now, in the first sentence the second proposition is
intended to tell <i>why</i> the ground is wet, just as the words
<i>this morning</i> tell <i>when</i> it is wet. Why a certain state
exists may be told by a phrase as well as by a proposition,
because it is only a modifying circumstance. It might
be told here by the prepositional phrase <i>from last night’s
rain</i>. If this second proposition, then, is put into the
sentence merely to tell something about some part of the
independent proposition, it is clearly subordinate, and
therefore dependent.</p>

<p>In the second sentence the second proposition does not
express any modification of any idea in the first proposition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</span>
It states a conclusion drawn from the fact stated
in the first proposition, and in the author’s mind the
conclusion is of equal importance with the fact that
supports it. We may even supply the conjunction <i>and</i>
before <i>hence</i>, which shows that the two propositions are
coördinate, so if one is independent the other must be.</p>

<p>It may be said that if the conjunction <i>hence</i> is taken
as a part of the following proposition, the proposition
cannot stand alone any more than can the proposition introduced
by <i>because.</i> But <i>because</i> must be taken as a part
of its proposition because it indicates the special modifying
circumstance—not time, or place, but cause—which the
author intended that proposition to denote, whereas <i>hence</i>
is not a part of the following proposition because that
proposition is not intended, as we have shown, to be a
modifier of any part of the preceding proposition, but a
conclusion drawn from the whole of it. <i>Because</i>, indicating
subordination is a subordinating conjunction
and always a part of the proposition it introduces. <i>Hence</i>,
indicating equality, or grammatical coördination, is a
coördinating conjunction and never a part of the proposition
following it.</p>



<p><b>The Partially Compound Sentence.</b>—Since there are
three well defined types of sentences, it is natural that
there should be forms lying in between any two of these
types and partaking of the nature of both. One of these
forms, the complex-compound sentence, we have already
spoken of. Another form is found in the following sentence,—“The
diseases, the elements, fortune, gravity,
lightning, respect no persons.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p>Here there are several subjects but only one assertion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</span>
made, hence only one proposition. The sentence resembles
both the compound sentence and the simple sentence,
but is, strictly speaking, neither one. It is called
<i>partially compound</i>, and may be considered a fifth kind
of sentence. Sometimes it contains only one subject but
two or more predicates,—“He shook his head, shouldered
the rusty firelock, and, with a heart full of trouble and
anxiety, turned his steps homeward.”—<i>Irving.</i></p>

<p class="c sp">THE CLASSIFICATION OF SENTENCES ACCORDING TO FORM</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">We</span> have classified sentences according to their structure
as simple, complex, compound, partially compound,
and complex-compound. There is another classification
made on the basis of form, which gives us three kinds of
sentences,—<i>declarative</i>, <i>interrogative</i>, <i>imperative</i>. These
three forms arise from the fact that there are three modes
of communicating thought; viz., by assertion, by question,
by command.</p>

<p><b>The Declarative Sentence.</b>—A declarative sentence is
one that states or declares something,—“Aunt Celia has
an intense desire to improve my mind.”—<i>Mrs. Wiggin.</i></p>

<p>This is the commonest kind of sentence, especially in
books, for it is the business of an author to inform his
readers of his own thoughts, not to inquire after theirs.
It is the style of sentence best fitted for relating events,
describing objects, or making clear any difficult subject.
Its order is usually the natural one, first the subject and
then the predicate. Variations from this order will be
taken up as they present themselves in connection with
different sentence-elements.</p>

<p><b>The Interrogative Sentence.</b>—An interrogative sentence
is one that asks a question,—“Who now reads the ancient
authors?”—<i>F. Harrison.</i></p>

<p>This kind of sentence is used often in conversation, both
oral and written. It is also common in addresses, such
as sermons and lectures, where the speaker asks questions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</span>
of his audience, not for the purpose of getting an answer,
but that he may make a more direct appeal to them.</p>

<p>In books we often meet such an interrogative sentence
as this,—“What courage can withstand the ever-during
and all-besetting terrors of a woman’s tongue?”—<i>Irving.</i></p>

<p>The purpose of this sentence is not to inquire, to ask a
question of anybody, but to give emphatic expression to
a thought. It is a rhetorical device for making an assertion
forcible. The author of the sentence quoted was so
positive of the truth of his thought that, instead of declaring
it, he put it in the form of a question, meaning, however,—“There
is <i>no</i> courage that can withstand, etc.”</p>

<p>Interrogative sentences are of two kinds:</p>

<p>1. Those that can be answered by <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>,—“Can
a man weigh off and value the glories of dawn against
the darkness of hurricane?”—<i>De Quincey.</i></p>

<p>These sentences put in question the whole thought, and
are usually in the inverted order, the auxiliary of the
predicate verb coming before the subject.</p>

<p>2. Those that cannot be answered by <i>yes</i> or <i>no</i>,—“Why
should the trees be so lovely in Japan?”—<i>Hearn.</i></p>

<p>These sentences put in question only one point, either
the subject, the object, an attribute of the subject or object,
or some circumstance of time, manner, place, cause,
etc. They usually begin with an interrogative word, such
as the pronouns <i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>what</i>, or the adverbs <i>how</i>,
<i>when</i>, <i>why</i>, <i>where</i>.</p>

<p>Interrogative sentences have sometimes the same order
and arrangement of words as declarative sentences. It is
only by hearing them spoken or noting their punctuation
that we know they are interrogative; for example,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</span>
“Scrooge knew he was dead?”—<i>Dickens.</i> This is
equivalent to—“Did Scrooge know that he was dead?”</p>

<p>Before analyzing an interrogative sentence, its order,
if inverted, should be changed to that of the declarative
sentence. Motley’s question,—“When did one man
ever civilize a people?” becomes for analysis,—“One
man did ever civilize a people when?” Notice that the
<i>time</i> of an action is the point in question here, and the
desired answer will be this very same sentence with only
two changes, the omission of <i>ever</i> and the substitution of
a word or phrase signifying a definite time, for the word
<i>when</i>.</p>


<p><b>The Imperative Sentence.</b>—An imperative sentence is
one that conveys a command,—“Tell me why you have
brought me to this place.”—<i>Caine.</i></p>

<p>The command is frequently so mild that it becomes
more a request or piece of advice,—“Speak as you
think, be what you are, pay your debts of all kinds.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p>Sometimes it is even an entreaty,—“Give us this day
our daily bread.”</p>

<p>A very common form of the imperative sentence is that
introduced by the imperative word <i>let</i>,—“<i>Let</i> the dessert
be served and the fruit brought.” This generally
expresses more of a wish than a command. The same
idea is brought out in such a sentence as the following,—“Come,
sit we down and talk.” Here the present subjunctive
<i>sit</i> is employed. Both of these sentence-forms
may be considered as substitutes for the first and third
person imperative, which is lacking in English.</p>

<p>In imperative sentences we use the imperative mood of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</span>
the verb and so usually dispense with the subject, the
verb becoming thus the first word in the sentence. For
analysis the subject is to be supplied. It is always a personal
pronoun of the second person, <i>you</i>, <i>thou</i>, or <i>ye</i>.
The verb may be a simple imperative, as <i>go</i>; an emphatic
imperative, <i>do go</i>; or a progressive imperative, <i>be going</i>,
or <i>do be going</i>.</p>


<p><b>The Exclamative Sentence.</b>—Any one of the three forms
of sentences may become exclamative by mode of utterance,
but the exclamative sentence does not communicate
thought in a way different from the other three sentences,
nor is it different in form, hence it should not be
considered a fourth kind of sentence.</p>

<p>A declarative sentence made exclamative.—“Alas!
the silence which was then settling on that aged ear was
an everlasting silence!”—<i>De Quincey.</i></p>

<p>An interrogative sentence made exclamative.—“Who
could have imagined the whirlwind of passion that was
going on within me as I reclined there!”—<i>Jefferies.</i></p>

<p>An imperative sentence made exclamative.—“Sit
down, all of you, and listen to me!”—<i>Lewis Carroll.</i></p>


<p class="c p1">Exercise 4</p>

and as to form. A sentence compound in structure may
have members different in form, that is, one member may

<p class="c sp">THE ADJECTIVE CLAUSE</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—A common form of the dependent proposition
is the adjective clause, so called not because it is
equivalent to an adjective, but because it performs the
office of an adjective, that is, modifies a substantive. It
is true that some adjective clauses may be changed to adjectives,
participles, or prepositional phrases, but there are
many more whose meaning cannot be conveyed by any<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</span>
adjective, participle, or phrase at our command. For
example, in this sentence from Macaulay,—“In climates
<i>where wine is a rarity</i>, intemperance abounds,” there is
no equivalent simpler adjective element into which the
clause could be changed.</p>

<p>Moreover, a clause gives more dignity and importance
to the thought conveyed by it than a shorter adjective element
gives. Often, too, a sentence loses in definiteness
by the abridgment of an adjective clause. For example,
the sentence,—“The statue that was made of marble
pleased me most,” may be changed to,—“The marble
statue pleased me most.” But, whereas the first sentence
means that the marble statue pleased me more than the
other statues, the second may mean either the same or
that the statue pleased me more than some other objects,
not statues. In other words, it is clear that the clause is
restrictive, while in the abridged sentence it is impossible
to decide whether <i>marble</i> is used to restrict or to describe.</p>

<p>Another advantage of the clause is, that it does not
require to be so near the word that it modifies as does an
adjective or a participle. Take the following sentence,—“No
act of oppression has ever been imputed to him
<i>which has not a parallel in the annals of the Tudors</i>.”—<i>Macaulay.</i>
Here the clause is separated from <i>act</i> by the
entire predicate of the principal proposition.</p>


<p><b>Classification.</b>—There are two kinds of adjective
clauses, according to the purpose for which they are used
in the sentence.</p>

<p>1. The <i>restrictive</i> adjective clause.—This is one which
restricts, or narrows, the application of the noun it modifies
to some particular individual or class.—“He <i>who</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</span>
<i>never changed any of his opinions</i> never corrected any of
his mistakes.”—<i>Hall.</i> Here the clause points out the
particular individual designated by the pronoun <i>he</i>.</p>

<p>A restrictive clause is doubly expressive;—it says one
thing directly and another by implication. In the sentence
quoted the clause implies that there are people who
do change their opinions.</p>

<p>Usually the restrictive clause is near the word it modifies,
is not set off by a comma, and is introduced by the
relative pronoun <i>that</i>, or a conjunctive adverb, or such a
phrase as <i>in which</i>, <i>by which</i>, etc. No adjective clause,
however, should be tested by any or even all of these accidents,
but rather solely by the purpose for which the
author used it.</p>

<p>2. The <i>unrestrictive</i> adjective clause.—This is one
that merely adds a thought to some idea already expressed.
The additional thought is often valuable, but it
is never necessary.—“The window of the little parlor
looked down upon the water, which had made friends
with its painted ceiling, and bestowed tremulous golden
smiles upon it when the sun shone.”—<i>Howells.</i> The
clause here is evidently not used to point out which water
is meant, but to tell something further about the water,
something unnecessary to the truth of the sentence, but
valuable in giving the reader a beautiful picture. Such
a clause is sometimes merely a definition or expansion of
a term already used; for example, “Style, <i>which is the
peculiar manner in which a writer expresses his thoughts</i>,
depends to some extent upon the age in which he lives.”</p>


<p><b>Introductory Word.</b>—The adjective clause, being a
dependent proposition and modifying a substantive, needs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</span>
some word to indicate its subordination and join it to its
substantive. This word may be several parts of speech.</p>

<p>1. A relative pronoun,—<i>who</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>that</i>. This pronoun,
besides serving as a connective, is a necessary element
of the clause. It may be—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Subject of the verb,—“The nature of his subject
compelled him to use many words that would have
made Quintilian stare and gasp.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Direct object of a verb,—“So I had arrived in
Venice, and I had felt the influence of that complex spell
<i>which</i> she lays upon the stranger.”—<i>Howells.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Indirect object of a verb,—“We must be as courteous
to a man as we are to a picture, <i>which</i> we are willing
to give the advantage of a good light.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Object of a preposition,—“Other men are lenses
through <i>which</i> we read our own minds.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Subjective complement,—“He will never be the
hero <i>that</i> his brother was.”</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) Possessive modifier,—“Its members are inflexible
men, <i>whose</i> ability has been as frequently manifested
as their patriotism.”—<i>Howells.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—To ascertain the use of a relative pronoun in a clause,
substitute the antecedent for the pronoun, and observe how the
antecedent is used. Sometimes this substitution requires a slight
change in the arrangement of the words of the clause. For example,
in (<i>e</i>) above, the clause <i>that his brother was</i> becomes <i>his
brother was hero</i>.</p></div>

<p><i>That</i>, when used as object of a preposition, must precede
the preposition; as, “Have you ever heard the Lady—the
one <i>that</i> I sit next <i>to</i> at the table—say anything
about me?”—<i>Holmes.</i></p>

<p><i>That</i> is frequently omitted when object of a verb or
preposition; as, “One of the shop windows he paused<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</span>
before was that of a second-hand book-shop.”—<i>George
Eliot.</i></p>

<p><i>As</i> and <i>but</i> are sometimes used as relative pronouns;
the former after <i>such</i>, <i>same</i>, <i>as many</i>, and a few other expressions,
the latter after an interrogative or negative
antecedent, and as an equivalent of the relative <i>that</i> plus
<i>not</i>; as, “There is nothing born <i>but</i> has to die.”</p>

<p>The relative pronoun <i>as</i> may be—</p>

<p>(a) Subject of a verb,—“I went up from the cabin
followed by as many <i>as</i> could mount the gangway.”</p>

<p>(b) Object of a verb,—“Chaucer has left us such a
picture of contemporary life <i>as</i> no man ever painted.”—<i>Lowell.</i></p>

<p>(c) Object of a preposition,—“He was such a schoolboy
<i>as</i> a discerning master delights in.”—<i>Mrs. Ward.</i></p>

<p>(d) Subjective complement,—“I shall probably
never see just such another day <i>as</i> yesterday was.”—<i>Burroughs.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Notes.</span>—1. When <i>as</i> introduces an adjective clause, the verb of
the clause is frequently omitted; as, “Their military code bore the
same stern features as their other laws (<i>bore</i>).”—<i>Prescott.</i></p>

<p>2. The use of the relative pronoun <i>as</i> after <i>as many</i> has been extended
so that we find it after <i>as few</i>, <i>as much</i>, <i>as little</i>; as, “She
was done for and bought for ten pounds by the landlord of the
Drummond Arms, Crieff, who had been taking <i>as much</i> money out
of her, and putting <i>as little</i> corn into her, <i>as</i> was compatible with
life.”—<i>Dr. John Brown.</i></p>

<p>3. The word <i>such</i>, which usually precedes a noun modified by an
as-clause, may follow the noun instead; as, “The walls did not flow
or subside to the valley in charming curve-lines, <i>such as</i> I have
seen in the wildest passes of the New England mountains.”—<i>King.</i>
Instead of transposing <i>such</i>, which would alter the meaning slightly,
we may say that it is a pronominal in apposition with <i>curve-lines</i>
and modified by the restrictive adjective clause <i>as I have seen</i>, etc.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</span></p>

<p>2. A conjunctive adverb.—This is equivalent to a
phrase consisting of a preposition and a relative pronoun,
and is used interchangeably with such a phrase. Its
function in the clause is the same as that of the phrase,
that is, it modifies the verb. The commonest of these
adverbs are <i>when</i> (= <i>in which</i> or <i>on which</i>), <i>where</i> (= <i>in
which</i> or <i>on which</i>), <i>whither</i> (= <i>toward which</i>), <i>whence</i>
(= <i>from which</i>). Others less used are <i>wherein</i>, <i>whereon</i>,
<i>whereof</i>, <i>wherethrough</i>, <i>wherefrom</i>, <i>wherewith</i>,
<i>whereupon</i>, <i>wherefore</i>, <i>whereby</i>, <i>whereat</i>. For example,—</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Our works are the mirrors <i>wherein</i> the spirit first sees its
natural lineaments.—<i>Carlyle.</i></p>

<p>Some day you may reach that time <i>when</i> a man lives in

    <div class="verse indent0">Forever and forever when I move.—<i>Tennyson.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

</div>

<p>3. The subordinating conjunction <i>that</i>.—This is often
used to introduce restrictive clauses modifying a word
denoting time. It is equivalent to a phrase like <i>in which</i>;
for example, “At last the season comes <i>that</i> the sixtieth
minute is due.”</p>

<p>This connective is sometimes used instead of <i>why</i> after
the word <i>reason</i>. It is frequently omitted; as, “The instant
he understood my meaning, he obeyed.”</p>


<p><b>What the Adjective Clause modifies.</b>—The adjective
clause may modify a noun used in any relation, a personal
pronoun, a pronominal adjective, or any other substantive.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</span>
Sometimes, instead of modifying any single word, it modifies
the thought expressed by the whole of the preceding
sentence, or by a portion of it. In such a case the clause
is introduced by the relative pronoun <i>which</i>. For example,
“They had comported themselves with such singular
wisdom and propriety that they were never either
heard or talked of,—<i>which, next to being universally
applauded, should be the object of ambition of all ages,
magistrates, and rulers</i>.”—<i>Irving.</i> Here the clause
modifies <i>that they were never either heard or talked of</i>.
In the sentence,—“His body was of an oblong form,
particularly capacious at bottom; <i>which was wisely
ordered by Providence, seeing that he was a man of
sedentary habits, and very averse to the idle labor of
walking</i>,” the clause modifies all of the sentence preceding
it.</p>

<p>Sometimes in sentences of this kind the thought to be
modified by the adjective clause is summed up in one
noun which is used as a part of the clause, while the
relative pronoun <i>which</i> becomes a relative adjective modifying
the noun; as, “In 1835, Longfellow became Professor
of Modern Languages and Belles Lettres in Harvard
University, <i>which position</i> he held for fourteen
years.”</p>

<p>An adjective clause modifying a whole statement is
sometimes placed before that statement instead of after it.
The clause is then usually introduced by the pronoun
<i>what</i>; as, “<i>What was worse</i>, he every week lost more and
more by bad money.”—<i>Jerrold.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The adjective clause may modify a noun or pronoun in
the possessive case; as, “The world is <i>his who has money to go
over it</i>.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</span></p>

<p><b>Position of the Adjective Clause.</b>—Usually it follows
closely the word it modifies, but there is a type of sentence
in which the clause modifies the subject and yet
comes next to the subjective complement. The following
sentence is an example,—“It was coffee and not wine
that I drank.”—<i>Howells.</i> <i>It</i> is here a personal pronoun
standing for <i>beverage</i> and modified by the restrictive adjective
clause <i>that I drank</i>. The sentence means,—The
beverage that I drank was coffee and not wine.</p>

<p>Peculiar sentences sometimes arise from this construction;
for example, “It is only birds of prey that fear
danger from below more than from above.” Here the
clause modifies the subject <i>it</i>, and the sentence transposed
reads, “It that fear danger from below more than from
above is only birds of prey.” This sounds ungrammatical,
but it is the interpretation of the original sentence.</p>

<p>In regard to the position of the connective, it is commonly
the first word in the clause; but when <i>who</i> or <i>which</i>
is object of a preposition, the preposition leads, and sometimes
the subject of the clause precedes the preposition
and the relative; thus, “The largest class of vessels is the
full-rigged ship, <i>the distinctive mark of which</i> is that it
has three masts, all square-rigged.” This arrangement of
words arises from the objection that some authors have
to using <i>whose</i> as the possessive of <i>which</i>. If <i>whose</i>
were substituted for <i>of which</i> in the sentence above, the
clause would read, <i>whose distinctive mark is</i>, etc.</p>

<p>Sometimes the antecedent of a relative pronoun is
omitted, especially if it is a personal pronoun; thus,</p>

<p class="c sp">THE ANALYSIS OF SIMPLE, PARTIALLY COMPOUND,<br>
AND COMPLEX SENTENCES</p>


<p>1. <span class="smcap large">Study</span> the sentence as to number and kind of
propositions, to determine whether it is simple, partially
compound, or complex. Determine also whether it is
declarative, interrogative, or imperative. Name it according
to both structure and form. If it has been
rendered exclamative, state that fact.</p>

<p>2. If the sentence is simple, separate it into its two
parts, subject and predicate.</p>

<p>3. Analyze the subject; that is, separate it into the
substantive used as base-word and the adjuncts of that
substantive.</p>

<p>4. Analyze the predicate; that is, separate it into predicate
verb, complement, and modifiers (provided the verb
has these adjuncts).</p>

<p>5. If the complement is complex, analyze it by separating
it into base-word and modifiers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Do not talk about “complete subject” and “simple subject,”
neither “logical predicate” and “grammatical predicate.”
The subject is the subject; the predicate is the predicate. That
ends it.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</span></p>

<p>6. If the sentence is complex, containing an adjective
clause, proceed the same as in the analysis of simple sentences,
analyzing the clause last.</p>

<p>7. When the clause is given as an adjunct of some
noun, state whether it is restrictive or unrestrictive, and
give its introductory word.</p>

<p>8. If any subject or predicate is partially compound,
state that fact before analyzing it.</p>

<p>Always proceed logically. In analyzing the sentence,
“The city editor laid a clipping from the morning paper
on the desk,” do not say that <i>from the morning paper</i>
is a phrase modifying <i>clipping</i>. Say instead that <i>clipping</i>
is modified by the prepositional phrase <i>from the
morning paper</i>. In other words, get new elements by
reaching out from elements that you already have.</p>

<p>Always proceed from the whole to the part. Do not
say that <i>laid</i> is completed by the object <i>clipping</i>, for that
is only part of the object. The object is <i>a clipping from
the morning paper</i>. After giving this as a unit, or whole,
separate it into base-word and modifiers.</p>

<p>Do not analyze a simple prepositional phrase like <i>on
the desk</i>. It is a waste of time. If the phrase is complex,
that is, contains a phrase, like <i>from the morning
paper of July first</i>, it should be analyzed.</p>

</div>

<p class="c sp">THE SUBSTANTIVE CLAUSE</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—The substantive clause is one that performs
some office of a noun. It is not a mere substitute
for a noun, however, used for the sake of variety. On
the contrary, it is seldom possible to change a noun clause
to a noun, and just because there is no equivalent noun
in the language. In the sentence,—“I fear that he will
come,” it would appear at first thought that the noun
clause, <i>that he will come</i>, might be changed to <i>his coming</i>,
but this would change the meaning; for the clause implies
that his coming is not expected with any certainty, while
the expression <i>his coming</i> implies that it is so expected.
Every time, in fact, that a noun clause is used, it serves
a distinct purpose, and it is safe to assume that in a well-constructed
sentence no other element would answer so
well. Let us discover some of these purposes.</p>

<p>In the following sentence from Burroughs,—“To
what extent the birds or animals can foretell the weather
is uncertain,” we have predicated something not of a
person, place, or thing, that could be named by a noun,
but of a <i>thought</i>, the statement of that thought telling
us of an agent and an activity performed by that agent.
Hence, by means of the noun clause we can make predications
of thoughts instead of things.</p>

<p>In the sentences,—</p>

<p>“Now one codicil in my general law of freedom had
been that my seventeenth birthday should not find me
at school”; and, “The consequence is, that the seven, or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</span>
nine, or fourteen lines have a marvellous aptitude at knotting
themselves up beyond the reach of skill and patience,”—we
are enabled by means of noun clauses to tell what
the codicil and the consequences are. We might give a
general definition of such nouns by means of other nouns,
but to tell what this special codicil and what this special
consequence are there is no other way than by the use of
the noun clause. Hence, by means of the noun clause,
we can make certain predications that could be made in
no other way.</p>

<p>In the sentence,—</p>

<p>“Whatever ornaments she wears are of massive gold,”—we
have made a predication of certain ornaments; but
instead of enumerating them in a long list we have designated
them by means of a noun clause, brief but more
comprehensive than any list could be. Hence, a noun
clause may be used to designate things when we have no
names for them, or wish to withhold the names, or find
it awkward to use them.</p>



<p><b>Uses of the Substantive Clause.</b>—As a sentence-element
it has most of the important uses of the noun.</p>

<p>1. Subject of a verb,—“<i>What is true of individual
men</i> is true also of races.”—<i>Lowell.</i> Frequently, for
the sake of a more pleasing arrangement, the anticipative
subject <i>it</i> is used, and the real subject, a noun clause, is
placed after the predicate,—“<i>It</i> matters little <i>what virtues
a man has</i>, if he is habitually inexact.”</p>

<p>A common type of sentence, similar to this, is one in
which the anticipative subject is followed by the verb <i>is</i>,
next by an adverb, or a phrase, or a clause, and then by
the real subject; for example, “It is chiefly through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</span>
books that we enjoy intercourse with superior minds.”
If we say, “It is chiefly through books,” the question at
once arises, “What is chiefly through books?” The
answer is, “the fact that we enjoy intercourse with superior
minds.” Transposing the sentence, we have,—“That
we enjoy intercourse with superior minds is chiefly
through books,” the verb is being employed in the sense
of <i>happens</i> or <i>is true</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In the following sentences from Robert Louis Stevenson
it is interesting to observe how such a sentence as the one just
described comes about:</p>

<p>“In the midst of this Babylon I found myself a rallying point;
every one was anxious to be kind and helpful to the stranger. This
was not merely from the natural hospitality of mountain people, nor
even from the surprise with which I was regarded as a man living
of his own free will in Le Monastier, when he might just as well
have lived anywhere else in this big world.”</p>

<p>It is evident that the pronominal adjective <i>this</i>, which is subject
in the second sentence, stands for the second proposition in the
preceding sentence. How easily might the following sentence have
been made,—“It was not merely from the natural hospitality of
mountain people that every one was anxious to be kind and helpful
to the stranger.”</p>
</div>

<p>This type of sentence must be carefully distinguished
from one given in the lesson on adjective clauses; for
example, “It is the universal nature which gives worth
to particular men and things.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p>2. Object of a verb,—“It is hard to believe <i>that we
shall get any good from exercise proportionate to the
sacrifice of time</i>.”—<i>Hamerton.</i> This is the commonest
use of the noun clause. Many of the verbs that
take clauses for objects denote action of the senses, the
mind, or the emotions,—as <i>feel</i>, <i>see</i>, <i>hear</i>; <i>believe</i>, <i>think</i>,
<i>know</i>; <i>desire</i>, <i>hope</i>, <i>fear</i>. The clause is very useful after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</span>
such verbs, for instance, after <i>see</i>; for besides seeing
objects we see those objects performing actions or existing
in certain states, and often the only way to tell this
is by means of the noun clause. Often, too, it would be
impossible to particularize what we believe, or think, or
hope, or imagine, or dream, without the aid of a noun
clause.</p>

<p>When verbs that take a direct and an indirect object
are changed to the passive form in such a way that the
indirect object becomes subject, we find the direct object
remaining after the passive verb.</p>

<p>Active.—“He told me that the tide was rising.”</p>

<p>Passive.—“I was told that the tide was rising.”</p>

<p>In the second sentence the clause is object of the verb
<i>was told</i>.</p>

<p>3. Objective complement.—“Understanding, that is,
equilibrium of mind, intellectual good digestion,—this
with unclogged biliary ducts, makes the Saxon mentally
and physically <i>what we call a very fixed fact</i>.”—<i>Lowell.</i>
Here the clause helps to complete the verb <i>makes</i> and at
the same time tells us something about the direct object
<i>Saxon</i>.</p>

<p>4. Object of a preposition.—“How utterly powerless
are our senses to take any measure or impression of the
actual grandeur of <i>what we see</i>.”—<i>King.</i> A noun
clause so used is not always at first sight easily distinguished
from an adjective clause whose first word is
a preposition, but there are several points of difference.
In the adjective clause the preposition is a necessary part
of the clause, governing some word in the objective case,
and its position may be shifted to the end of the clause.
The noun clause used as object of a preposition is generally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</span>
introduced by the word <i>what</i>, which does not introduce
adjective clauses.</p>

<p>The preposition governing a noun clause is frequently
omitted.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) After the adjectives <i>aware</i>, <i>certain</i>, <i>glad</i>, <i>sure</i>,
<i>positive</i>, etc., especially when used as predicate adjectives,—“When
you saw a lad with that book on the desk before
him, you might be <i>sure</i>, without asking, <i>that he had
deserved the master’s approval in some way</i>.”—<i>Annie
Preston.</i></p>

<p>If a noun were used instead of a clause after <i>sure</i>, it
would be introduced by a preposition; but it is English
usage to dispense with the preposition when we use a
clause, though the clause certainly answers the same question
as the noun, viz., <i>sure of what</i>? In disposing of a
clause so used, say that it is brought in by the adjective
without the help of a preposition, or supply the preposition,
or supply the phrase <i>of the fact</i>, disposing of the
clause as an appositive of the noun <i>fact</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) After such predicates as <i>is determined</i>, <i>is convinced</i>,
<i>is resolved</i>, etc.—“I am convinced <i>that every
spring a large number of birds which have survived the
southern campaign return to their old haunts to breed</i>.”—<i>Burroughs.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>After</i> the verbs <i>assure</i> and <i>warn</i>,—“You very
soon assure yourself <i>that such springs are also fed by
rain</i>.”—<i>Tyndall.</i></p>

<p>“He immediately discharged two muskets into the
darkness, to warn the enemy <i>that he knew of their presence
and intention</i>.”</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) After some nouns like <i>doubt</i>, <i>assurance</i>, <i>evidence</i>,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</span>
etc.—“Cæsar saw no evidence <i>that the gods practically
interfered in human affairs</i>.”—<i>Froude.</i></p>

<p>5. In apposition.—“We look not to the question
<i>whether a man have or have not children to be benefited
by the education for which he pays</i>.”—<i>Webster.</i> Here
the clause makes definite the word <i>question</i>, a noun of
wide application.</p>

<p>We occasionally come across sentences constructed
like the following,—“What a man does, that he has.”—<i>Emerson.</i>
The meaning is,—“A man has what he
does,” the noun clause <i>what he does</i> being object of the
verb <i>has</i>. But in the original sentence the pronominal
<i>that</i> is object of <i>has</i>, and this indefinite object is explained
by the noun clause <i>what a man does</i>, which is
therefore to be called an appositive. Such an arrangement
arises from a desire to make the clause prominent
and also to hold the main thought in suspense until the
end of the sentence.</p>

<p>6. Subjective complement.—“In fact, the only difference
between one of these ice streams and an ordinary
river is, <i>that the former moves very slowly</i>.”</p>



<p><b>Introductory Word.</b>—The substantive clause may be
introduced by—</p>

<p>1. The relative pronouns, <i>what</i>, <i>whatever</i>, <i>whatsoever</i>,
<i>who</i>, <i>whoever</i>, <i>whoso</i>, <i>whosoever</i>, <i>which</i>, <i>whichever</i>.
When introducing noun clauses none of these words have
an antecedent, hence it might be more precise to call
them merely pronouns. Their office is more than an
introductory one, for they have a function within the
noun clause, just as relative pronouns have within adjective
clauses.—“I wondered <i>who the priest was that</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</span>
<i>wore it</i>.”—<i>Howells.</i> Here the pronoun <i>who</i> is the subjective
complement of the verb was in the clause.</p>

<p>2. The adjectives <i>what</i>, <i>whatever</i>, <i>whatsoever</i>, <i>which</i>,
<i>whichever</i>, <i>whichsoever</i>. These are indefinite limiting
adjectives.—Tell me <i>what time it is</i>.</p>

<p>3. The words <i>if</i>, <i>that</i>, <i>whether</i>. These are ordinarily
subordinating conjunctions, but when introducing noun
clauses they should not be considered connectives at all;
for a subject does not need to be connected to its predicate,
nor a complement to the verb it completes, nor an
appositive to the noun it explains. These introductory
words serve rather to put the clause into shape, to make
it appear as a subordinate part of the sentence.—“‘I
wonder <i>if his heart is any softer</i>,’ thought the Fox.”—<i>Froude.</i>
“The truth now flashed upon me <i>that my companion
was a schoolmaster</i>.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p>The introductory <i>that</i> is sometimes understood.—“It
is true <i>all things have two faces, a light one and a dark</i>.”—<i>Carlyle.</i></p>

<p><i>Whether</i> usually takes <i>or</i> as a correlative,—“Chaucer
did not waste time in considering <i>whether his age were
good or bad</i>.”—<i>Lowell.</i></p>

<p>4. Conjunctive adverbs, like <i>where</i>, <i>when</i>, <i>how</i>, <i>why</i>.
These words always modify some word in the clause.—“We
need not say <i>how much we admire his public conduct</i>.”—<i>Macaulay.</i>
<i>How</i> modifies the adverb <i>much</i>.</p>

<p>5. <i>But</i> or <i>but that</i>, being equivalent to <i>that not</i>.—“‘Who
knows <i>but in the end I may turn into a dog</i>?’
said the Fox.”—<i>Froude.</i></p>



<p><b>“There” used as an Anticipative Subject.</b>—We have
already spoken of the anticipative subject <i>it</i>, whose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</span>
office is to throw the real subject after the predicate
verb. Another word used in the same way is <i>there</i>; for
example, “<i>There</i> is no good reason for a bad action.”—<i>Spurgeon.</i></p>

<p>This word is not the adverb <i>there</i>, for it conveys no
idea whatever. It does nothing at all for the meaning of
the sentence, as is shown by our slighting it in reading.</p>

<p>After the anticipative subject <i>there</i> the real subject is
almost always a noun with modifiers, but it may be a
noun clause; for example,—“No, indeed, there is no
wonder <i>that God loved the world</i>.”—<i>Phillips Brooks.</i></p>

<p>The verb in these sentences is usually some form of the
verb <i>be</i>. It is not the copula so often as it is the complete
intransitive verb <i>be</i>, meaning <i>exist</i>. In the sentence,—“There
are many kinds of sea fowl that feed
on fish and build their nests on the sea coast,” the entire
predicate is the verb <i>are</i>.</p>

<p>When the verb is a copula it is often completed by a
prepositional phrase denoting an attribute of the subject.
For example, “There is not a crevice in it where
anything green can lodge and grow.”—<i>King.</i> Here
the predicate is <i>is in it</i>.</p>

<p>Other intransitive verbs are occasionally found after
<i>there</i>, as in the sentence, “There <i>came</i> to the beach a
poor exile of Erin.”—<i>Campbell.</i></p>

<p class="c sp">ANALYSIS OF SENTENCES CONTAINING NOUN CLAUSES</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">It</span> is most convenient to analyze the noun clause last,
even if it is the subject of the sentence. As soon as the
clause is mentioned, however, as a sentence-element, its
introductory word should be given. Clauses within the
noun clause should be disposed of after the rest of the
noun clause has been analyzed.</p>

<p>A direct quotation is frequently introduced into a sentence
to fulfill the office of a noun clause. In structure
and form it is like an independent proposition, but in
function it is subordinate; for example, “The first and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</span>
last and closest trial question to any living creature is,
“<i>What do you like?</i>”—<i>Ruskin.</i></p>

is interrogative.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF TIME</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—All actions or events can be referred to
some time—past, present, or future. Frequently the
whole significance of an event depends upon either the
time of its occurrence or its duration; hence it is often
desirable and sometimes necessary to tell the time when
an action takes place or state the period of its continuance.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</span>
We may do this by means of single words,
like <i>then</i>, <i>now</i>, <i>tomorrow</i>, <i>forever</i>, or by phrases, like <i>a
long time ago</i>, <i>at the present day</i>, <i>before supper</i>, <i>till the
end of the world</i>. Frequently, however, we wish to fix
the time of one activity with relation to the time of some
other activity. To do this we usually employ a proposition
in the form of a temporal clause; for example,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The British soldier trembles</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">When Marion’s name is told.”—<i>Bryant.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Here the action of trembling is said to take place at
the time of another action, the telling of Marion’s name.
Notice that from this sentence we get double information,
(1) that two actions occur simultaneously, (2) that one
is the cause of the other.</p>



<p><b>Introductory Word.</b>—All time clauses are introduced
by some word which in itself denotes time, and which is
chosen because of the special meaning attached to it.
This word subordinates the clause to the principal proposition,
and connects it to that part of the principal proposition
which the clause modifies. Most grammarians
say that this connective is a conjunctive adverb, and
that it not only connects the two propositions but also
modifies the verb in the clause. To us its grammatical
office seems to be that of a mere connective, hence we call
it a subordinating conjunction of time. The several
conjunctions of this class can best be studied in sentences
containing them.</p>

<p>1. “<i>When a prisoner first leaves his cell</i>, he cannot
bear the light of day.”—<i>Macaulay.</i> Here <i>when</i> is
chosen in order that the sentence may signify that the two
actions occur at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</span></p>

<p><i>Then</i> in the principal proposition is sometimes used as
a correlative of <i>when</i> in the clause. <i>Then</i> is not a necessary
word, but if the clause is long, <i>then</i> is useful in informing
the reader that the principal proposition is about
to begin.</p>

<p>2. “Man should forget his anger <i>before he lies down
to sleep</i>.”—<i>De Quincey.</i> <i>Before</i> (sometimes <i>ere</i>) makes
a sentence signify that the main action occurs in time
previous to the time of the action expressed in the clause.</p>

<p>3. “<i>After I had learned to row in the gondolier fashion</i>,
I voyaged much in the lagoon with my boat.”—<i>Howells.</i>
<i>After</i> makes the sentence signify that the main action occurred
later than the action in the clause.</p>

<p>Sentences in which temporal clauses are introduced by
<i>when</i>, <i>before</i>, <i>ere</i>, or <i>after</i>, only establish for us the proper
relation between two points of time; viz., that one point
coincides with another, is antecedent to it, or subsequent
to it. If we wish to denote the duration of a state or an
activity, we introduce the temporal clause by <i>while</i>, <i>since</i>,
<i>till</i>, or <i>until</i>.</p>

<p>4. “<i>While they sat at dinner</i>, a great fire of sunset
spread over the west.”—<i>Black.</i> <i>While</i> signifies <i>during
the time that</i>.</p>

<p>5. “<i>Since you were at Oulton</i>, my wife has been growing
worse and worse in health, and more and more eccentric
and crotchety.”—<i>Shorthouse.</i> <i>Since</i> signifies <i>from
the time that</i>.</p>

<p>6. “<i>Till men have been some time free</i>, they know not
how to use their freedom.”—<i>Macaulay.</i> <i>Till</i> signifies
<i>up to the time that</i>.</p>

<p>7. If we wish to be exact about the time that something
begins, we introduce the temporal clause by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</span>
phrase <i>as soon as</i>, or <i>soon as</i>, which phrase may be considered
one connective,—“<i>As soon as it is convenient to</i>
you, I shall be glad for you to leave this sombre place.”—<i>Shorthouse.</i></p>

<p>8. <i>As</i> is frequently used either for <i>when</i> or for <i>while</i>.</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The boat had touched the silver strand,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Just <i>as the hunter left his stand</i>.”—<i>Scott.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>9. If we wish to state exactly when something ends,
we introduce the temporal clause by <i>as long as</i>, or <i>so long
as</i>,—“<i>So long as men had slender means, whether of
keeping out cold or checkmating it with artificial heat</i>,
Winter was an unwelcome guest, especially in the country.”—<i>Lowell.</i></p>

<p>10. <i>Whenever</i> means <i>at any time that</i>,—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Yet <i>whenever I cross the river,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent14"><i>On its bridge with wooden piers</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Like the odor of brine from the ocean</div>
    <div class="verse indent14">Comes the thought of other years.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent19">—<i>Longfellow.</i></div> 
 </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>11. Clauses introduced by <i>now that</i> denote both time
and cause, and it is often difficult to determine which of
the two ideas is more prominent. In the sentence,—“What
do you think of your home <i>now that you see it</i>?”—<i>Black</i>,
there is certainly more of time than of cause,
for if the verb in the principal proposition were changed
from the present tense to either past or future, <i>when</i>
would be substituted for <i>now that</i>.</p>



<p><b>What the Time Clause modifies.</b>—Since we use a
time clause to tell (1) when a state exists or when an activity
is performed, (2) the duration of an activity or a
state, it is clear that the clause modifies a word denoting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</span>
state or action, namely, a verb. Usually it modifies a
predicate verb, but it may modify the verbals, either infinitives
or participles.</p>

<p>It must be noted here that modifiers vary in their closeness
to the word modified; and therefore in analyzing
sentences modifiers should be given, not in the order of
their position, but in the order of their closeness. In the
sentence,—“One night, shortly after the coldest weather
set in, he lost his oar as he was returning to the island,”
the verb <i>lost</i> is modified by three elements denoting time,
(1) <i>as he was returning to the island</i>, (2) <i>one night</i>,
(3) <i>shortly after the coldest weather set in</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In the sentence just quoted, the connective <i>after</i> is preceded
by the adverb <i>shortly</i>, which is put into the sentence to tell
how long after the coldest weather set in, hence it is a modifier of
the whole clause. Other adverbial clauses than those of time may
be modified in this way; for example, The Puritans espoused the
cause of civil liberty <i>mainly</i> because it was the cause of religion.</p>
</div>

<p>It is interesting and instructive to note that other ideas
may be associated with that of time in a temporal clause.
A clause introduced by <i>until</i> sometimes denotes result as
well as time.—“Skirts grew more and more bulbous <i>until
it did not need more than three or four women to make
a good-sized assembly</i>.”—<i>Warner.</i></p>

<p>A clause introduced by <i>since</i> may denote time and
cause.—“<i>Since I have begun to examine these expressive
little brutes</i>, I have made many profound observations.”—<i>H.
James.</i></p>

<p>A clause introduced by <i>when</i> may denote time and condition.—“<i>When
the eyes say one thing and the tongue
another</i>, a practiced man relies on the language of the
first.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p class="c sp">THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF PLACE</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—Just as all events occur at some time, so do
they also occur in some place. We have not many adverbs
of place in English, and few of these are very definite;
for example, <i>here</i>, <i>there</i>, <i>yonder</i>, <i>somewhere</i>, <i>anywhere</i>,
<i>hither</i>, <i>thither</i>, <i>up</i>, <i>down</i>, <i>in</i>. Hence we usually
tell place by means of prepositional phrases, and we have
many prepositions of place, such as <i>above</i>, <i>across</i>, <i>along</i>,
<i>amid</i>, <i>among</i>, <i>around</i>, <i>at</i>, <i>before</i>, <i>behind</i>, <i>below</i>, <i>beneath</i>,
<i>beside</i>, <i>between</i>, <i>beyond</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>over</i>, <i>up</i>. The value of
the prepositional phrase denoting place is seen in the following
sentence from Longfellow, which contains three
such phrases:</p>

<p>“It stood upon the brink of a little glassy pool whose
tranquil bosom was the image of a quiet and secluded life,
and stretched its parental arms over a rustic bench that
had been constructed beneath it for the accommodation
of the foot traveler, or, perchance, some idle dreamer
like myself.”</p>

<p>But the prepositional phrase will not always serve our
turn, for sometimes we wish to denote a certain place by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</span>
telling what happens there, and to do this it is usually best
to employ a proposition. This gives rise to the adverbial
local clause. In the following sentence from Lowell,—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent14">“Where today the martyr stands,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">On the morrow crouches Judas with the silver in his hands,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>in order to tell the place where Judas crouches, the poet
tells what happens in that place, namely, that it is the
place where today the martyr stands.</p>



<p><b>Introductory Word.</b>—The local clause is introduced by
the subordinating conjunctions of place, <i>where</i>, <i>wherever</i>,
<i>whence</i>, <i>whither</i>, <i>whencesoever</i>, <i>whithersoever</i>. <i>Whither</i>
conveys the idea of action going <i>toward</i> a place, and
<i>whence</i> of action proceeding <i>from</i> a place. These two
conjunctions and their compounds as well are not often
used by modern writers.</p>

<p><i>Wherever</i> means <i>in any place</i>; as, “Wherever the
Anglo-Saxon race goes, there law, industry, and safety
for life and property are certain to arise.”—<i>Dickens.</i></p>

<p>Just as <i>when</i> in a temporal clause often takes the correlative
<i>then</i>, so <i>where</i> or <i>wherever</i> in a local clause is
often accompanied by <i>there</i> in the principal proposition,
as in the sentence just quoted.</p>



<p><b>Peculiarities of the Local Clause.</b>—Often a local
clause denotes condition as well as place; for example,
“Wherever money is the principal object of life with
either man or nation, it is both got ill and spent ill.”—<i>Ruskin.</i></p>

<p>Sometimes the idea of time exists along with that of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</span>
place; for example, “Where one person is really interested
by music, twenty are pleased by good reading.”—<i>Hart.</i></p>

<p>The adverbial clause of place is not common, and yet
we frequently meet clauses introduced by <i>where</i>, <i>whence</i>,
etc. Most of these are adjective clauses, and as such they
have two uses, as may be seen in the following typical
sentences:</p>

<p>(1) “Being newly from a land <i>where everything,
morally and materially, was in good repair</i>, I rioted sentimentally
on the picturesque ruin, the pleasant discomfort
and hopelessness of everything about me here.”—<i>Howells.</i>
The clause here is restrictive, used to point out
a certain land, and <i>where</i> is equivalent to <i>in which</i>.</p>

<p>(2) “Dr. Livingstone, a Scotchman, spent many years
in exploring Central Africa, <i>where he finally perished</i>.”—Here
the clause is equivalent in meaning to an independent
proposition, <i>where</i> meaning <i>and there</i>, but nevertheless
it has the structure of a dependent proposition.</p>

<p>Select local clauses in the following sentences, telling
what each clause modifies, what it denotes, and its connective:</p>

<p class="c sp">THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF MANNER</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—A common question in regard to activities
is <i>how?</i> This is oftenest answered by means of an adverb
or a prepositional phrase; as, sew <i>neatly</i>, study <i>diligently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</span></i>,
go <i>with dispatch</i>. But it is to be noticed that
these elements tell how in an absolute way with no reference
to a fixed standard, and are capable of many degrees
of interpretation, for people’s notions of neatness, diligence,
and dispatch differ.</p>

<p>Adverbs and prepositional phrases are unsatisfactory
in another respect also;—the manner of an action can
seldom be characterized by one term, so unless we wish
to call attention to only one characteristic, we must employ
several terms, or leave the action incompletely described.
But if we use a clause we may tell exactly how
an action is performed by comparing it with some other
action familiar and understood, which it more or less
precisely resembles; for example, “Sing out, children,
<i>as the little thrushes do</i>.”—<i>Mrs. Browning.</i> Here the
clause conveys one clear and definite impression to all who
have heard the thrushes sing, an impression that it would
take a whole list of adverbs to convey, like <i>sweetly</i>, <i>joyfully</i>,
<i>thrillingly</i>, <i>spontaneously</i>; but how like a catalogue
these sound, and how little they appeal to the imagination.</p>

<p>Frequently a mental action, an action of the emotions
or of the will, or something else not immediately intelligible,
is made clear by comparing it with something
material, something evident to the senses. In such sentences
we find the familiar figure of speech called <i>simile</i>;
thus, “Poetry produces an illusion on the eye of the mind,
<i>as a magic lantern produces an illusion on the eye of the
body</i>.”—<i>Macaulay.</i> Here the clause of manner modifies
the entire predicate of the principal proposition.</p>



<p><b>Introductory Word.</b>—The ordinary connective of the
modal clause is the subordinating conjunction <i>as</i>, though<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</span>
its place is sometimes taken by <i>as if</i> or <i>as though</i>, both of
which expressions it is best to consider one conjunction.
In the sentence,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“The maiden paused as if again</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>She thought to catch that distant strain</i>,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>the clause conveys an idea of purpose in the maiden’s
pausing as well as an idea of manner. This clause may
be expanded to read <i>as she would pause if again she
thought to catch that distant strain</i>, where the clause of
manner contains a clause of condition.</p>

<p>A clause introduced by <i>as though</i> cannot be so expanded.
“I will invest your money <i>as though it were
my own</i>,” cannot be made to read—“I will invest your
money as I would invest it though it were my own.” This
is proof that the clause has been thought of only as a
clause of manner, and <i>as though</i> as only one connective.</p>

<p>Notice that when a modal clause is introduced by <i>as if</i>
or <i>as though</i>, the action or state in the clause is represented
not as real but only as assumed.</p>



<p><b>Position of the Modal Clause.</b>—The usual position
of a clause of manner is after the predicate it modifies,
but sometimes it precedes the principal proposition and is
made emphatic by the adverb <i>just</i>, <i>even</i>, or <i>precisely</i>, used
as a clause modifier; thus, “<i>Just as we estimate the importance
of a river—not by its length nor by its breadth,
but by the amount of water it contributes to the ocean</i>—so
we estimate the size of a city by the number of people
it contains.”</p>

<p>When the clause is long and comes first, the principal
proposition is often introduced by <i>so</i>, a correlative of <i>as</i>
in the clause; as in the example above.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE ANALYSIS OF SENTENCES</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">We</span> are now ready to analyze sentences containing adjective
clauses, noun clauses, and adverbial clauses of
time, place, and manner.</p>

<p>It frequently happens that there is a clause within a
clause. The first clause is then to be treated as if it were
a complex sentence, and the second clause analyzed when
the rest of the first clause has been disposed of. In the
sentence,—“He felt as if he would like to stay till every
ship that had sailed out of Monterey in the last three years
had returned,” the predicate contains a clause of manner
introduced by <i>as if</i> and extending to the end of the sentence.
In this modal clause the infinitive <i>to stay</i> is modified
by a temporal clause introduced by <i>till</i> and extending
to the end of the sentence. In this temporal clause the
base-word of the subject, <i>ship</i>, is modified by the restrictive
adjective clause introduced by the relative pronoun
<i>that</i> and extending through the word <i>years</i>. So we have
an adjective clause within a temporal clause which is
within a modal clause.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF CAUSE</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—In our daily experience we are continually
meeting new conditions, discovering new truths. It is
human nature to be curious as to the causes of these truths
and conditions, hence there is no question perhaps which
is asked oftener than the query of the scientist, the persistent
question of the child, <i>why?</i> So common is this
question that in our speech we anticipate its coming and
answer it before it is asked. When we make statements
of facts or of our opinions, we seem to foresee that we
shall be asked <i>why?</i> or <i>how do you know?</i>—so along
with our principal statement we give a cause or reason
for it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</span></p>

<p>Sometimes we are able to tell cause or reason by means
of a phrase, as, He trembled <i>from fright</i>, The wind must
be blowing <i>by the sound</i>. But the usual way is by means
of the subordinate proposition; thus, “Peter the Great
caused his heir to be tried and sentenced to death, <i>because
he was a sot, a liar, and a fool</i>.”—<i>Lord.</i></p>



<p><b>What the Causal Clause denotes.</b>—1. It may denote
the natural or physical cause of some physical effect either
in nature or in man; as, “Journeys by individuals could
not be undertaken without much risk, <i>for there was
scarcely a moor or a forest that had not its highwaymen</i>.”—<i>Draper.</i></p>

<p>This clause answers the question <i>why?</i> One variety
of it, often called a clause of motive, denotes something
that determines man’s choice, something that leads him to
pursue a line of action; as, “He discouraged commerce,
not <i>because it was in itself demoralizing, but because it
brought the Jews too much in contact with corrupt
nations</i>.”—<i>Lord.</i></p>

<p>A clause of motive answers the question <i>why?</i> or <i>what
made him do it?</i> It can be used only to modify a statement
about a human being or perhaps one of the higher
animals—something that can act from a motive.</p>

<p>2. The causal clause may denote the cause of our
knowledge of a fact, the evidence from which we draw a
conclusion, but not the cause of the fact itself; as, “The
other bird probably grew to maturity, <i>as it disappeared
from the vicinity with its parents after some days</i>.”—<i>Burroughs.</i>
This clause, sometimes called a clause of
reason, answers the question <i>how do you know?</i> or <i>what
makes you say so?</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</span></p>

<p>Notice that all these causal clauses denote something
that was true or in operation before what is in the principal
proposition was true or in operation. In other
words, the causal clause denotes the source from which
something proceeds; the outcome or result is found stated
in the principal proposition.</p>



<p><b>Connectives.</b>—The commonest connective of the
causal clause is the subordinating conjunction <i>because</i>,
but we often find <i>for</i>, <i>as</i>, or <i>since</i> used in its place. Sometimes
<i>that</i> is used; as, “And we wept <i>that one so lovely
should have a life so brief</i>.”—<i>Bryant.</i> When for or
because introduces a clause, we know that the clause is
causal, but <i>as</i>, <i>since</i>, and <i>that</i> may introduce clauses used
in other relations, so the nature of the clause in question
must be determined by its meaning.</p>

<p>There are several phrases that may be used as conjunctions
to introduce causal clauses. These are <i>seeing that</i>,
<i>now that</i>, <i>considering that</i>, <i>in that</i>, <i>inasmuch as</i>, <i>forasmuch
as</i>. These phrases should be considered as one
word, having the function of the word <i>because</i>.</p>

<p>The connective is often dispensed with entirely when
the relation of cause is very plain; thus, “One man goes
four thousand miles to Italy, and does not see it, <i>he is so
short-sighted</i>.”—<i>Curtis.</i></p>



<p><b>What the Causal Clause modifies.</b>—When the verb in
the principal proposition denotes action, the clause modifies
the verb, or it may modify some participle or infinitive
denoting action; as, “Work is a thing done <i>because
it ought to be done, and with a determined end</i>.”—<i>Ruskin.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</span></p>

<p>When the verb is a copula, the clause modifies the verb
and its complement, as the verb has not in itself sufficient
meaning to be modified. In the sentence,—“To John
Inglesant, who had always been devotedly attached to his
brother, this display of affection was delightful, <i>cut off
as he had been so long from all sympathy and friendliness</i>,”
the clause modifies <i>was delightful</i>. In this clause
the position of the subordinating conjunction as is
usurped by <i>cut off</i> in order to give prominence to those
words. The clause may be transposed, however, so that
<i>as</i>, meaning <i>because</i>, comes first.</p>



<p><b>Position of the Causal Clause.</b>—Usually the causal
clause follows the principal proposition. When it comes
first, being in an unusual position it becomes more prominent
and therefore more impressive, and the principal
proposition is also rendered more forcible by being placed
at the end of the sentence; for example, “<i>And as they still
continued to multiply</i>, there came forth the dreadful edict
that every male child of the Hebrews should be destroyed
as soon as born.”—<i>Lord.</i></p>

<p class="c sp">CLAUSES OF PURPOSE AND RESULT</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> preceding chapter treated of clauses bearing the
relation of cause to the principal proposition and denoting
something true or operative before the thought in
the principal proposition was true or operative. We have
now to consider clauses which are the reverse of causal
clauses, namely, <i>final</i> clauses. These denote something
that is true or will be true after what is stated in the principal
proposition is true. In other words, they denote an
end or a consequence realized or to be realized as a result
or outcome of the statement in the principal proposition.
According to their relation to the principal proposition,
they may be classified as clauses of <i>purpose</i> and clauses
of <i>result</i>.</p>



<p><b>1. The Clause of Purpose.</b>—The purpose clause denotes
an intended consequence, which is to follow from the
action or condition expressed in the principal proposition;
as, “If natural death seemed to be coming on, they
would cut wounds in their flesh, <i>that Odin might receive
them as warriors slain</i>.”—<i>Carlyle.</i> This sentence
shows that the clause of purpose answers the question
<i>what for?</i> and is put into a sentence to explain or justify
the act in the principal proposition.</p>

<p>It is evident that, since a clause of purpose denotes an
intended consequence of an act or condition, that act or
condition must be performed or brought about by some
being capable of forming an intention, hence the principal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</span>
proposition states something, either directly or indirectly,
about a voluntary act, usually the act of a human being.
This is oftenest stated directly, as in the example above;
but occasionally we find such sentences as the following,—“The
door of Scrooge’s counting-house was open
<i>that he might keep his eye upon his clerk</i>.”—<i>Dickens.</i>
Here the clause by no means denotes the door’s purpose
in being open, but Scrooge’s purpose in keeping it open.</p>

<p>The clause of purpose may be introduced by the conjunctions
<i>that</i>, <i>so that</i>, <i>in order that</i>. The negative purpose
clause is introduced by <i>lest</i> (= <i>that not</i>); as, “We
must both speak low <i>lest she should waken</i>.”—<i>Brontë.</i></p>

<p>The clause of purpose is seldom met, not because the
purpose of an act is seldom told, but because it can usually
be told more briefly by means of the infinitive; thus,
“Garrisons were established in the larger cities <i>to keep
down revolt and to enforce the payment of tribute</i>.”</p>



<p><b>2. The Clause of Result.</b>—This denotes not an intention
but the consequence of the act or condition expressed
in the principal proposition; as, “The kingly
power among the Jews was checked and hedged by other
powers, <i>so that an overgrown tyranny was difficult and
unusual</i>.”—<i>Lord.</i></p>

<p>The clause of result is often employed to tell the degree
of some quality or attribute, as in the sentence,—“Washington
was so rigidly punctual <i>that when Hamilton,
his secretary, pleaded a slow watch as an excuse for
being five minutes late, he replied, ‘Then, sir, either
you must get a new watch or I must get a new secretary.’</i>”
Here the clause tells how punctual Washington
was, but it does this by telling a result of his punctuality.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</span>
Notice that in the first example the clause may be said
to modify the verbs in the principal proposition, <i>was
checked</i> and <i>was hedged</i>, but in the second sentence it
modifies the verb and its complement, <i>was so rigidly
punctual</i>.</p>

<p>The clause of result is introduced by <i>that</i>, <i>so that</i>, or,
if both principal proposition and clause are negative, by
<i>but</i> or <i>but that</i>. These connectives except <i>so that</i> are
usually associated with the correlative <i>so</i> or <i>such</i> in the
principal proposition. This correlative modifies an adjective
or an adverb, and serves as a hint that a clause
of result is to follow. As an example of a negative clause
of result, we have the following sentence,—“The long,
warm days of summer never return <i>but they bring with
them a gloom</i>.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p class="c sp">THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF CONDITION</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—We are seldom able to make unqualified
statements, because few facts are universally true. On
the contrary, we must carefully hedge in our statements
by certain restrictions, and a useful means for doing this
is the adverbial clause of condition. For instance, “The
knight ever came to the rescue of a woman in danger
or distress,” is a sweeping statement, and would instantly
be disputed unless we add the conditional clause, “<i>provided
she was a lady</i>.”</p>

<p>Such a clause is often so important that writers place it
at the beginning of the sentence as if they wished to
guard against contradiction or misunderstanding, by putting
their readers at once into the proper attitude for
comprehending their principal statement.</p>

<p>If we examine a few typical sentences, we shall see
how useful is the condition clause in a variety of ways.</p>

<p>1. “<i>If nettles and thistles grow in my cabbage garden</i>,
I don’t try to persuade them to grow into cabbages.”—<i>Froude.</i>
Here the clause states a condition which is to
be regarded as really taking place. The idea of time is
also associated with that of condition.</p>

<p>2. “<i>If, in the least particular, one could derange the
order of nature</i>,—who would accept the gift of life?”—<i>Emerson.</i>
The clause here states an imaginary condition,
but at the same time implies what is the real state
of the case; namely, that no one can, in the least particular,
derange the order of nature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</span></p>

<p>3. “I might have been a minister myself, for aught I
know, <i>if this clergyman had not looked and talked so like
an undertaker</i>.”—<i>Holmes.</i> Here the sentence is so
framed that the contrary of both clause and principal
proposition is implied; namely, this clergyman did look
and talk exactly like an undertaker, hence I am not a
minister. Is it not wonderful that by means of one set
of words we may say two opposite things, and not fail
of being understood?</p>

<p>4. “<i>If I was ever weak enough to give anything to
a petitioner of whatever nationality</i>, it always rained decayed
compatriots of his for a month after.”—<i>Lowell.</i>
Here the subordinate thought is put into the form of a
clause of condition, but at the same time we understand
that we are to find in it the <i>cause</i> of the principal proposition.</p>

<p>5. “Middlingness is always pardonable, <i>so that one
does not ask others to take it for superiority</i>.”—<i>George
Eliot.</i> The clause is here a saving clause. It states the
exception necessary to be made in order that the principal
proposition may be accepted as true.</p>

<p>6. “<i>If my friend was not a genius</i>, he was certainly
a monomaniac.”—<i>H. James.</i> This sentence does not
mean that my friend was a monomaniac provided he was
not a genius, but is a brief way of saying,—If you assert
that my friend was not a genius, you will then have to admit
that he was certainly a monomaniac.</p>

<p>7. “She has met the equinoctials before, <i>if it is the
equinoctials that are beginning</i>.”—Black. Here the
clause does not state a condition for the principal proposition,
but for some thought not expressed,—this, perhaps:
<i>and can meet this storm</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</span></p>

<p>In these sentences we have by no means shown all
that may be accomplished by the conditional clause. We
have only indicated the types of sentences most frequently
met with in which this clause occurs.</p>



<p><b>What the Conditional Clause modifies.</b>—The conditional
clause is usually brought into the sentence by the
predicate of the principal proposition, and so must be
looked upon as an adjunct of that predicate. Sometimes,
however, it modifies a gerund, participle, or infinitive.
In the sentence;—“She must have a story, well, ill, or
indifferently told, <i>so there be life stirring in it, and plenty
of good or evil accidents</i>,” the clause modifies the participle
<i>told</i> after it has been modified by the adverbs <i>well</i>,
<i>ill</i>, and <i>indifferently</i>.</p>



<p><b>Introductory Word.</b>—1. The subordinating conjunctions
<i>if</i>, <i>so</i>, <i>unless</i> (= <i>if not</i>).</p>

<p>2. The phrases <i>on condition that</i>, <i>conditionally that</i>,
<i>in case that</i>, <i>provided that</i>, <i>but that</i>, <i>so that</i>. These
should be considered as one word.</p>

<p>3. The imperatives <i>say</i>, <i>let</i>, <i>suppose</i>; as, “<i>Suppose you
were going to carpet a room</i>, would you use a carpet
having representations of flowers upon it?”—<i>Dickens.</i>
Here the condition seems to be actual and present, not
imaginary.</p>

<p>4. The participles <i>providing</i>, <i>provided</i>, <i>supposing</i>.
The first two are especially useful in introducing a restriction.</p>

<p>Sometimes there is no connective, but the subordination
and the nature of the clause are indicated by the
order of the words, the verb or its auxiliary being placed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</span>
before the subject; thus, “<i>Had I twenty girls</i>, they should
be brought up exactly in this fashion.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p class="c sp">THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF CONCESSION</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—In the compound sentence,—“The whale
is not a fish, but we speak of the ‘whale fishery,’” we
have joined two thoughts which are opposed to each
other, but we have made them of equal importance.
Now, if we wish to make one of them more prominent,
and at the same time indicate that it is true in spite of
the other, we construct our sentence as follows,—“The
whale is not a fish <i>though</i> we speak of the ‘whale
fishery.’”</p>

<p>Here the main thought is <i>the whale is not a fish</i>, and
by the form in which we have expressed the other
thought, we have shown not only that there is an opposition
between the two thoughts,—which was likewise
shown in the compound sentence,—but also that it is
strange that the two thoughts are true at the same time
when they seem mutually contradictory. This second
sentence is complex, and the dependent proposition is an
adverbial clause of concession. It does not necessarily
indicate that two thoughts are opposed to each other;
sometimes they only stand in contrast; as, “While<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</span>
(= <i>though</i>) his fame rests on his Meditations, as that of
David rests upon his Psalms, he yet rendered great military
service to The Empire.”—<i>Lord.</i></p>

<p>We may define a concessive clause as one that concedes
or grants something in contrast or opposition to what
is expressed in the principal proposition. It modifies
a verb or a verb with modifiers. It varies but little in
function, the slight variations being indicated by the
choice of the introductory word.</p>



<p><b>Introductory Word.</b>—1. <i>Though</i> or <i>although</i>. This
is the conjunction oftenest used; indeed, all the other
words or phrases used are more or less equivalent to it
in meaning. <i>Albeit</i> was formerly much used, and we occasionally
find it in poetry now, but it is very seldom
used in spoken English or in ordinary prose composition.</p>

<p>2. <i>Whether.</i>—This word with its correlative <i>or</i> is
used when we wish to say that a thing is true in spite of
two other facts or conditions which are contrary to each
other; as, “The balconies are always charming, <i>whether
they hang high over the streets or look out upon the
canals</i>.”—<i>Howells.</i></p>

<p>3. The indefinite pronouns <i>whoever</i>, <i>whatever</i>, <i>whichever</i>;
the adjectives <i>whatever</i> and <i>whichever</i>; and the
adverb <i>however</i>. These words signify that the clause
is to be taken in its widest possible application; as,
“<i>Upon whatever career you may enter</i>, intellectual quickness,
industry, and the power of bearing fatigue are three
great advantages.”—<i>Huxley.</i> Here the clause means,—though
you may enter <i>upon any career whatsoever</i>.</p>

<p>4. <i>No matter.</i>—This phrase together with the adverb
<i>how</i> is a frequent substitute for the connective <i>however</i>.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</span>
It emphasizes the scope of the clause and thus makes the
opposition between the principal proposition and the
clause seem greater; thus, “The guns can be fired in any
direction, <i>no matter how the ship is lying</i>.”</p>

<p>5. <i>While.</i>—In some sentences this is nearly equivalent
to <i>though</i>; in others it carries with it an idea of time
as well as concession; thus, “Both Charles himself and
his creature Laud, <i>while they abjured the innocent badges
of popery</i>, retained all its worst vices.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p>6. <i>If.</i>—When the adversative relation between the
two propositions is perfectly clear without being indicated
by the connective, <i>if</i> or <i>even if</i> may be employed in the
place of <i>though</i>. A concessive clause so introduced must
not be confounded with the clause of condition. In the
latter <i>if</i> can be changed to <i>provided</i>; in the former <i>if</i> is
equivalent to <i>though</i>; for example, “<i>If the scenery failed
to charm</i>, the names of places did not fail to astonish
us.”—<i>Bolles.</i></p>

<p>7. <i>Notwithstanding</i> or <i>notwithstanding that</i>.—The
former of these is more frequently met with as a preposition
introducing a concessive phrase and meaning
about the same as <i>in spite of</i>; thus, “<i>Notwithstanding
the increasing illness of his sister</i>, he was able to enjoy
some cheerful society.”—<i>Ainger.</i> But sentences like
the following are not uncommon,—“<i>Notwithstanding
the wind was favorable to each alike</i>, both vessels had
deviated from the direct line and were steering toward
a common center.”—<i>Cooper.</i></p>

<p>8. A common form of the concessive clause is one in
which an adjective, a verb, an adverb, or a noun comes
first, followed sometimes by <i>though</i>, oftener by <i>as</i>. This
order of words arises from our desire to make prominent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</span>
or emphatic some particular attribute; as, “<i>Strange as
it may appear</i>, even the baron’s jokes seemed only to
render him the more melancholy.”—<i>Irving.</i> Here the
attribute <i>strange</i> is emphasized. That such a clause is
only an ordinary clause of concession transposed for a
special purpose, with as substituted for <i>though</i>, becomes
evident by comparing it with the clause in the following,—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent21">“Thy brow,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Glorious in beauty though it be</i>, is scarred</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">With tokens of old wars.”—<i>Bryant.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Transposing this clause to the natural order, we have,
“though it be glorious in beauty.”</p>

<p>In sentences containing a concessive clause the principal
proposition is sometimes introduced by <i>yet</i>, a correlative
of the connective in the clause. <i>Yet</i> is often
used when the clause comes first and is long. It is useful
in calling attention to the fact that the concession has
all been stated, gathering it up, as it were, into one word
before the principal statement is made.</p>

</div>

<p class="c sp">THE ADVERBIAL CLAUSE OF DEGREE OR COMPARISON</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—In Chapter XI. we showed that the manner
in which an action is performed is often denoted by an
adverbial clause. Now, it may sometimes be denoted by
an adverb, as in the sentence,—He accumulated his
learning <i>quietly</i>. But, in order to give force and point
to this adverb, it is frequently accompanied by a clause
of degree bringing in a comparison; thus, “He accumulated
his learning <i>as quietly as a stout lady accumulates
her fat</i>, by the daily satisfaction of his appetite.”—<i>Hamerton.</i>
By comparing the quietness with which he
accumulated learning to the quietness with which a stout
lady accumulates fat, we provide a standard or illustration
for the first thought, and so make it clear and impressive.</p>

<p>We often wish to tell in what degree a certain attribute
is possessed. This may be done by a clause of result, as
was seen in Chapter XIV., but we may also do it by comparison;
for example, “Thou shalt be happy <i>as heart can
wish</i>.” Here the degree of happiness thou shalt have is
fixed by saying that it is equal to what thy heart wishes.</p>

<p>Number and amount often cannot be told absolutely
but may be told relatively by means of a comparison;
thus, “Mrs. Patten had more respect for her neighbor
Mr. Hackit <i>than for most people</i>.”—<i>George Eliot.</i> It
would hardly be possible or worth while to tell exactly
the amount of respect that Mrs. Patten had for Mr.
Hackit, but it is worth telling how this respect compared
with the respect she had for other people.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</span></p>



<p><b>Classification of Clauses of Degree.</b>—1. A sentence
may assert that two attributes are <i>equal</i> in degree; as,
“They were as timid and cowardly as they were rebellious.”—<i>Lord.</i>
Here the degree of their timidity and
cowardice is shown by comparing these qualities with
their rebelliousness, and the two sets of attributes are
found to be equal. The clause in such a sentence is
usually introduced by the subordinating conjunction <i>as</i>,
and a correlative of this word usually precedes the word
in the principal proposition denoting the idea to be compared.
The first <i>as</i> is an adverb, being an adjunct of
either an adjective or an adverb. It may be omitted, as
was shown in the sentence,—Thou shalt be happy as
heart can wish.</p>

<p>A clause denoting equality of degree is sometimes introduced
by <i>as if</i>, which may be considered a compound
conjunction unless we choose to supply the ellipsis. In
the following sentence from Henry James, “I found as
great a fascination in watching the odd lights and shades
of his character <i>as if he had been a creature from another
planet</i>,”—we may supply between <i>as</i> and <i>if</i> the words
<i>I would have found</i>, thus obtaining a clause of degree
having within it a clause of condition.</p>

<p>If the whole comparison is placed first in the sentence,
the principal proposition is introduced by <i>so</i> followed by
the word denoting the respect in which two ideas are compared;
as, “But, as eminently as Homer is plain, so eminently
is the Elizabethan literature in general, and Chapman
in particular, fanciful.”—<i>Arnold.</i> The words <i>so
eminently</i> are not necessary for the complete structure of
the sentence, but they add to its clearness.</p>

<p>A statement containing a comparison of equality may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</span>
be denied by means of the negative adverb <i>not</i>, so that
the sentence amounts finally to an assertion of inequality
in degree; thus, “He is not by any means so wise as he
looks.”</p>

<p>2. A sentence may assert that two attributes are <i>unequal</i>
in degree; for example, “The manner of saying
things often makes a deeper impression than the thing
that is said (<i>makes</i>).”—<i>Brook.</i> Here the impression
made by the manner of speaking and the impression made
by the thing spoken are compared and said to be unequal
in depth. The clause in such a sentence is introduced
by the subordinating conjunction <i>than</i>, and is
always an adjunct of some word in the comparative degree,
or the words <i>else</i>, <i>other</i>, <i>otherwise</i>, or <i>rather</i>, the
last being in reality a comparative of the Old English
word <i>rathe</i>.</p>

<p>When a statement signifying inequality is denied by
some negative word, the sentence amounts to a statement
of equality; thus, “It is not more certain that Sarah
Gamp liked her beer drawn mild than it is that your Englishman
likes his poetry cut short.”—<i>Birrell.</i></p>

<p>In clauses of both varieties given above there is often
an ellipsis, the words omitted being those already expressed
in the principal proposition and hence easily supplied.
In the sentence, “Mrs. Patten had more respect
for her neighbor Mr. Hackit than for most people,” when
we analyze the clause we must fill it out so as to make
it read, <i>than she had respect for most people</i>.</p>

<p>3. The clause of degree may tell not that things <i>stand</i>
to each other in a relation of equality or inequality, but
that they vary in the same proportion; thus, “The deeper
the snow, the nearer the rabbit is brought to the tops of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</span>
the tender bushes and shrubs.”—<i>Burroughs.</i> Here the
rabbit’s nearness to the tops of the shrubs is said to vary
with the depth of the snow.</p>

<p>In sentences of this sort, both principal proposition and
subordinate proposition are constructed in the same form,
but the principal proposition may always be ascertained
by questioning the sentence; for example, does the foregoing
sentence assert that the depth of snow varies with
the rabbit’s nearness, or that the rabbit’s nearness varies
with the depth of snow? Clearly, the latter. Indeed, it
will almost invariably be found that in a sentence of this
kind, especially if it be addressed to the eye, the second
proposition contains the principal thought.</p>

<p>Sentences of this kind are often much abridged; thus,
“The more, the merrier,” “The sooner, the better.”</p>

<p>Another form of the idiomatic sentence just given is
one which makes use of the connective <i>in proportion as</i>;
for example, “People dread to be thought unsafe <i>in proportion
as they get their living by being thought to be
safe</i>.”—<i>Bagehot.</i> This can easily be changed to the
older form,—“The more people get their living by being
thought to be safe, the more do they dread to be thought
unsafe.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—<i>According</i> as may be used in place of <i>in proportion as</i>,
as in the following sentence,—“The Sonnets are more or less
striking according as the occasions which gave birth to them are
more or less interesting.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>
</div>

<p>Another form of this comparison is one in which the
two propositions are introduced by the prepositional
phrases <i>by as much</i> and <i>by so much</i>; for example, “Look
at the most vigorous species; <i>by as much as it swarms in
numbers</i>, by so much will it tend to increase still further.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</span></p>

<p>4. A fourth variety of the clause of degree is found in
the following sentence,—“Night in the tropics, <i>so far
as animal life is concerned</i>, is as the day.”—<i>Drummond.</i>
Here the group of words, <i>so far as animal life is concerned</i>,
tells the extent or degree to which night is like
day. It might be separated into the base-word <i>far</i> modified
by the adverb <i>so</i> and the clause <i>as animal life is concerned</i>;
but it does not seem to be the author’s purpose
to institute any comparison whatever, hence it is better
to consider the whole group of words as one element denoting
degree, and treat <i>so far as</i> as one subordinating
connective.</p>

<p>Sometimes a clause of this kind performs a double duty.
It gives the reason or ground for the main assertion and
at the same time makes that assertion somewhat doubtful;
for example, “<i>As far as I could observe when the meeting
broke up</i>, they separated without remark on the sermon.”—<i>Emerson.</i>
Here the principal statement is based upon
the writer’s observation when the meeting broke up; but
he implies that his main assertion may not be true, for his
observation may not have extended far enough to warrant
any certainty in his conclusion.</p>

</div>

<p class="c sp">THE COMPOUND SENTENCE</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> our study of dependent propositions, we have considered
in the main the complex sentence. We shall now
take up the compound sentence, whose distinguishing
characteristic is that it contains at least two independent
propositions. These propositions with their accompanying
clauses, if any, constitute the members of a compound
or complex-compound sentence, and such a sentence may
be classified according to the relation subsisting between
its members. On the basis of this relation we have the
following classification:—</p>

<p>1. Members may be <i>in the same line of thought</i>; that
is, they may denote related events succeeding each other
in time, or they may tell similar things about the same
subject, or the second may be added to the first by way
of supplementing or explaining it, etc. Sentences of this
kind are very common; as, “We consecrate our work to
the spirit of national independence, and we wish that the
light of peace may rest upon it forever.”—<i>Webster.</i></p>

<p>Connective.—For members in the same line of
thought the typical conjunction is <i>and</i>. All the other
connectives so used are equivalent to <i>and</i>, though they
may have a slight additional meaning. These are,—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The coördinating conjunction <i>nor</i> or <i>neither</i>,
equivalent to <i>and not</i>; as, “Bolts and bars are not the
best of our institutions, nor is shrewdness in trade a mark
of wisdom.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>While.</i>—This must be carefully distinguished
from the subordinating conjunction <i>while</i>, and from <i>while</i>
used to coördinate but equivalent to <i>but</i>; as, “His lower
limbs were sheathed like his body in flexible mail, securing
the legs and thighs, while (= <i>and</i>) his feet rested
in plated shoes which corresponded with the gauntlets.”—<i>Scott.</i></p>

<p>A common type of sentence which it seems best to
classify here is one in which the first member is imperative,
the second declarative, and the two joined by <i>and</i>;
as, “Tell me what you like, and I will tell you what you
are.”—<i>Ruskin.</i> This is equivalent in meaning to a
complex sentence containing a clause of condition,—“If
you tell me what you like, I will tell you what you are.”
But, inasmuch as the author used <i>and</i> between his two
propositions, it would seem that he intended the condition
to be equally important with the second statement. Sentences
of this kind have a directness of appeal to the
reader that gives them a peculiar force.</p>

<p>2. The members of a compound sentence may denote
<i>contrasting thoughts</i>; as, “In cities we study those
around us, but in the retirement of the country we learn
to know ourselves.”—<i>Longfellow.</i></p>

<p>The second member often denotes a thought not to be
expected after the first has been accepted; as, “Boys are
capital fellows in their own way, among their mates; but
they are unwholesome companions for grown people.”—<i>Lamb.</i>
This sentence reminds us of the complex sentence
containing a clause of concession, for it might easily
be recasted into one,—Though boys are capital fellows,
etc.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</span></p>

<p>Connective.—The typical conjunction for this sentence
is <i>but</i>; all the substitutes for <i>but</i> are merely its
various equivalents. These are,—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The conjunctions <i>yet</i>, <i>while</i>, <i>and yet</i>, <i>whereas</i>; as,
“It is no longer a reality; yet it was one.”—<i>Carlyle.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The adverbs <i>still</i>, <i>only</i>, <i>nevertheless</i>, <i>however</i>.
These are conjunctions when used alone between independent
propositions, adverbs when associated with <i>but</i>.
They all imply an opposition between the two members;
for example, “He is glad of his pay—very properly so,
and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years without
it—still, his main notion of life is to win battles, not to
be paid for winning them.”—<i>Ruskin.</i></p>

<p>3. Members of a compound sentence may present an
<i>alternation</i> or <i>choice between two thoughts</i>. In such a
case only one of the members is true; as, “Come down
and help us, Rustum, or we lose.”—<i>M. Arnold.</i> If the
first proposition here is fulfilled, the second will not be
true. If the second should be true, it would be because
the first was not fulfilled. Often, as in this example, the
second member denotes a consequence of something which
is the direct opposite of what is stated in the first member.</p>

<p>Connective word.—(<i>a</i>) The typical connective is
the coördinating conjunction <i>or</i>. Sometimes the first
member is preceded by <i>either</i>, a correlative of <i>or</i>. It may
be remarked here that or is much oftener met between
words or phrases than between propositions.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The adverbs <i>else</i> and <i>otherwise</i> when equivalent
to or may be used in its stead.</p>

<p>4. The second member of a compound sentence may
denote a result of the first, either a direct <i>consequence</i> or
a <i>conclusion</i>. In other words, the first member may<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</span>
denote (<i>a</i>) the cause of the second member; as, “They
speak English there, so your difficulties are now pretty
well over.”—<i>Brontë.</i> (<i>b</i>) The evidence which supports
the second member; as, “He was not at church
Sunday, hence he must have been ill.” Such sentences
suggest the complex sentences containing a clause of real
cause or a clause of reason; and owing to the causal relation
between the two members, it may seem at first sight
that one of them is a dependent proposition. But such
is not the case. Each of them is grammatically independent;
for both are presented as equally important, and
the coördinating conjunction <i>and</i> could be supplied
between them in addition to the other conjunction.</p>

<p>Connective.—The typical conjunction is <i>therefore</i>.
We also find <i>hence</i>, <i>wherefore</i>, <i>so</i>, <i>so that</i>, <i>so then</i>, <i>consequently</i>
and <i>accordingly</i>, all of which are equivalent
to <i>therefore</i>.</p>

<p>5. Frequently one member is added to another by way
of <i>explanation</i>, giving the author’s reason for making the
first statement. It is introduced by <i>for</i> and usually preceded
by a semicolon; thus, “Always pay; for first or last
you must pay your entire debt.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p>It is sometimes difficult to decide whether the second
member is independent or dependent, whether <i>for</i> is a
coördinating or a subordinating conjunction. The tests
for the independent proposition must be these:—Did
the author intend the second member to stand equal in
importance to the first? Does the second member add
something not necessary to the first member or affecting
its meaning? Does the second member express a thought
not perhaps in the author’s mind when he wrote the first?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</span></p>



<p><b>Omission of the Conjunction in Compound Sentences.</b>—Often
when the relation between two members is perfectly
evident, the connective is omitted. This frequently occurs
when the members are in the same line of thought; as,
“The place to observe nature is where you are; the walk
to take today is the walk you took yesterday.”—<i>Burroughs.</i></p>

<p>The connective is also omitted to avoid repetition when
the sentence contains several members, all sustaining the
same relation to one another. It should, however, be
noticed here that authors differ in their mode of punctuation.
One author might combine two sentences into one
compound sentence by placing a semicolon between them,
whereas another would place a period after each.</p>



<p><b>The Number of Members in a Compound Sentence.</b>—In
illustrating compound sentences we have given those
that contain only two members, but it must not be supposed
that the number is restricted to two. On the contrary
we often find three or more. However, these are
not often all of the same rank, and the sentence must first
be separated into coördinate members, then if these members
are compound they must be separated in like manner,
and so on. Take, for instance, the sentence,—“Genius
is mainly an affair of energy, and poetry is mainly an
affair of genius; therefore a nation whose spirit is characterized
by energy may well be eminent in poetry,—and
we have Shakespeare.”—<i>M. Arnold.</i> This complex-compound
sentence is, first of all, made up of a compound
sentence and a complex-compound sentence. The relation
between these two members is that of cause and
result, the second being a consequence of the first, as is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</span>
indicated by the conjunction <i>therefore</i>. The first of
these members is made up of two simple sentences in the
same line of thought, therefore joined by the conjunction
<i>and</i>. The second member is made up of a complex sentence
and a simple sentence, the second being an addition
to the first and therefore joined to it by <i>and</i>.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE CONJUNCTION IN SOME OF ITS USES</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> our study of complex and compound sentences we
have noted the office of conjunctions, both subordinating
and coördinating, so far as they join propositions. But
this is by no means their sole office nor their most common
one.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</span></p>



<p><b>The Coördinating Conjunction.</b>—The abridgment of
propositions has been carried so far that we find the
coördinating conjunctions, <i>and</i>, <i>or</i>, <i>but</i>, joining words or
phrases just as often as propositions, for example, “The
intimacy between man <i>and</i> nature began with the birth of
man on the earth, <i>and</i> becomes each century more intelligent
<i>and</i> far-reaching.” The first <i>and</i> joins the two
nouns <i>man</i> and <i>nature</i>, the second the two predicates
whose base-words are the verbs <i>began</i> and <i>becomes</i>, the
third the two adjective complements <i>more intelligent</i> and
<i>more far-reaching</i>.</p>

<p>There is nothing at all peculiar or difficult in this use
of the conjunction, for we naturally expect it to join any
two like elements, provided they have the same office in
the sentence. Occasionally, however, we find it joining
unlike elements; for example, “St. Edmund punishes
terribly <i>yet</i> with mercy.”—<i>Carlyle.</i> Here <i>yet</i> joins two
modifiers of the verb <i>punishes</i>, but one is an adverb, the
other a prepositional phrase.</p>

<p>A common substitute for <i>and</i> when it joins words or
phrases is <i>as well as</i>, the whole group of words having
the value of one conjunction; as, “Truth needs the wisdom
of the serpent as well as the simplicity of the dove.”—<i>Helps.</i>
This conjunction has a peculiar force. By
its aid the sentence just quoted tells us not that truth
needs two qualities, which the conjunction <i>and</i> would
imply, but rather that, while everybody grants that truth
needs the simplicity of the dove, it is the author’s opinion
that she needs, too, the wisdom of the serpent. It is
wonderful that the substitution of this little phrase <i>as
well as</i> for <i>and</i> can make a sentence so different in meaning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</span></p>

<p>A group of words similar in office to <i>as well as</i>, but
not so often used, is <i>no less than</i>; as, “The first lesson of
literature, no less than of life, is the learning how to burn
your own smoke.”—<i>Lowell.</i></p>

<p>Besides joining words, phrases, or propositions as the
elements of one sentence, the coördinating conjunction,
especially <i>and</i> or <i>but</i>, is often found at the beginning of
an entirely new sentence, where its function is to show
the relation in thought between the new sentence and the
one preceding. In such a position its office is not grammatical
but logical; for example, “<i>But</i> month after month
only showed the king the uselessness of further resistance.”—<i>J.
R. Green.</i> This conjunction is sometimes
reinforced by an adverb; thus, “<i>And again</i>, Drake’s cannon
would not have roared so loudly and so widely without
seamen already trained in heart and hand to work his
ships and level his artillery.”—<i>Froude.</i></p>



<p><b>The Subordinating Conjunction.</b>—Owing to abridgment
we find many sentences constructed like the following,—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Then safe, though fluttered and amazed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">She paused, and on the stranger gazed.”—<i>Scott.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Here the subordinating conjunction of concession,
<i>though</i>, seems to join two adjective modifiers of <i>she</i>.
These are <i>safe</i> and the two participial adjectives, <i>fluttered
and amazed</i>. Of course it would be proper to fill out the
ellipsis and make a clause of concession, <i>though she was
fluttered and amazed</i>, but it does not seem necessary, and
we certainly would not supply anything if <i>but</i> had been
used instead of <i>though</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</span></p>

<p>The subordinating conjunction <i>than</i> is used in this way
between like elements oftener than any other, especially
when it is associated with the adverb <i>rather</i>; for example,
“Commonly a light is for the eyes rather than for the
feet, and a lamp is to read or sew by rather than to walk
by.”—<i>Munger.</i> The ellipsis after <i>than</i> may be supplied
here, that is, we may make the sentence read as follows,—“Commonly
a light is rather for the eyes than it is for
the feet, and a lamp is rather to read or sew by than it is
to walk by.” But if the sentence had been,—“Commonly
a light is not for the feet <i>but</i> for the eyes,” etc., we
should say that <i>but</i> joins the two phrases and that the
first one is modified by <i>not</i>. So in the original sentence
we may say that the first <i>than</i> joins the two prepositional
phrases <i>for the eyes</i> and <i>for the feet</i>, while the second
joins the infinitives <i>to read or sew by</i> and <i>to walk by</i>.
<i>Rather</i> is then an adverb modifying in one case the phrase
<i>for the eyes</i>, and in the other the infinitives <i>to read or
sew by</i>.</p>



<p><b>Correlatives.</b>—The correlatives <i>when ... then</i>, <i>where ... there</i>,
<i>so ... as</i>, <i>as ... as</i>, <i>though ... yet</i>, <i>whether ... or</i>,
have been sufficiently noted in previous lessons. There
remains something to be said about the familiar pairs
<i>either ... or</i>, <i>neither ... nor</i>, <i>both ... and</i>, <i>not only ... but</i>.
The first three pairs are alike in use, the second
word in each case, <i>or</i>, <i>nor</i>, <i>and</i>, being the connective, and
the first no part of speech whatever. <i>Either</i>, <i>neither</i> and
<i>both</i>, when correlatives, merely hint that the real conjunction
is coming. The correct position of these words is
immediately before the first of the two elements joined
by the conjunction. <i>Either</i> and <i>both</i> may be omitted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</span>
without affecting either the meaning or the structure of
the sentence.</p>

<p>These correlatives are found with verbs, nouns, adjectives,
adverbs, phrases, or propositions either independent
or dependent; for example, “Generally, good
useful work, whether of the hand or the head, is either
ill-paid or not paid at all.”—<i>Ruskin.</i> “He neither pretended
to high blood nor in good truth cared one fig
about the matter.”—<i>Lamb.</i> “There is a working class—strong
and happy—among both rich and poor.”</p>

<p>The correlatives <i>not only ... but</i> are different in some
respects from the others. <i>But</i> is the conjunction, and
<i>only</i> is an adjective or adverb modifying the first of the
two words joined by <i>but</i>, while <i>not</i> makes this word
negative; thus, “Longfellow has not only charmed the
ear, but has touched the heart of the world.” In this
sentence <i>but</i> joins the two predicates. The first predicate
is modified by <i>only</i> and then denied by the negative
adverb <i>not</i>. In this use <i>but</i> is not an adversative conjunction,
that is, it does not signify any opposition between
the two predicates. The sentence means that
Longfellow has done two things which are in the same
line of action—he has charmed the ear of the world and
in addition has touched its heart.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for <i>but</i> to be reinforced by the adverb
<i>also</i>; for example, “Punctuality should be made not
only a point of courtesy, but also a point of conscience.”</p>

<p class="c sp">THE INFINITIVE PHRASE</p>


<p><b>Nature of the Infinitive.</b>—In the preceding lessons,
we have studied but one element of the sentence; namely,
the proposition. This combination of subject and predicate
we have looked at from the point of view of its value
as a sentence element, and we have found that in the communication
of thought it is of the utmost importance by
reason of its clearness. In this respect it is superior to
other simpler and briefer elements, but nevertheless in the
development of English prose we find the proposition
steadily superseded, wherever possible, by several of the
simpler elements. This is the result of an ever-growing
tendency toward brevity and conciseness. In a recent
monograph entitled “The History of the English Paragraph,”
the author states that the English sentence has
decreased in length at least one-half in three hundred
years, and that it has shown very great decrease in formal
predication. The means by which predication is avoided
without sacrificing clearness are various. One of them,
is the infinitive phrase, which we shall make the subject
of this chapter.</p>

<p>By an infinitive phrase we mean a group of words of
which an infinitive is the base, the whole group being the
equivalent of a clause and forming an element of a sentence.
It is an element employed so frequently that it is
very easily interpreted, and its great advantage is that it
enables us to dispense with a subject and predicate.</p>

<p>The infinitive is a verb-form differing from the finite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</span>
verb in this,—it expresses the action or state denoted by
the verb without the limitations of person and number,
hence it cannot predicate. It is defined by grammarians
as a verbal noun. This does not mean, however, that it
always has the use of a noun, but rather that it has the
nature of a noun in this important respect, that it <i>names</i>
the action or state denoted by the verb. Just as a noun
may be employed as an adjective or an adverb, thus, “I
have a <i>gold</i> watch,” “I am going <i>home</i>,” and still retain
its essential characteristic, that of being a name-word, so
the infinitive may be used adjectively or adverbially and
still be the name of an action or state. The infinitive
also retains its verb nature so far as to take any of the
modifiers or complements of the verb; for example, in
the sentence,—“To furl a sail is to roll it up and secure
it,” the subject is the infinitive phrase <i>to furl a sail</i>, the
base of which is the infinitive <i>to furl</i>. Now in so far as
<i>to furl</i> is subject it has the use of a noun; it has the nature
of a noun, too, in naming an act; but it also has the nature
of a verb insomuch as it denotes action performed upon
the object <i>sail</i>.</p>



<p><b>Forms of the Infinitive.</b>—There are two infinitives,
the root infinitive, or infinitive with <i>to</i>,—<i>to see</i>, <i>to run</i>,
<i>to be</i>,—and the gerund, or infinitive in <i>-ing</i>,—<i>seeing</i>,
<i>running</i>, <i>being</i>. We shall study first the root infinitive.
Besides the simple form, <i>to see</i>, called the present active
infinitive, there is the perfect active infinitive, <i>to have
seen</i>, and the corresponding passive forms, <i>to be seen</i> and
<i>to have been seen</i>. We may also add the active progressive
forms, <i>to be seeing</i> and <i>to have been seeing</i>. Intransitive
verbs of course lack the passive forms. Of all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</span>
these forms the one most used in the communication of
thought is the simplest one of all, the present active.</p>



<p><b>Uses of the Infinitive.</b>—The infinitive is used for
many different purposes, but nearly always in relation to
some word whose meaning it serves to make more clear
and without which it would not be in the sentence at all.
These relations of the infinitive to other words may perhaps
be most clearly explained if we consider them in
groups; (1) its relation to the noun, (2) to the verb,
(3) to the adjective or adverb.</p>

<p>I. A noun may have an infinitive associated with it in
two ways:—</p>

<p>1. As an adjective; as, “Leaves have their time <i>to fall</i>.”—<i>Mrs.
Hemans.</i> Here the infinitive is brought into the
sentence by the noun <i>time</i>, to specify what time the leaves
have. The expression <i>time to fall</i> means <i>falling time</i> or
<i>time for falling</i>. In the following sentence from Carlyle,—“He
that speaks what is really in him will find men
<i>to listen</i>,” the infinitive defines the noun <i>men</i>, being
equivalent to the restrictive adjective clause <i>who will
listen</i>, so we must say of the infinitive that it is used like
an adjective modifying <i>men</i>. It is better than the clause,
being simpler and briefer.</p>

<p>2. As a noun in apposition; as, “He had formed the
heroic resolution <i>to defend the tower alone against the
enemy</i>.” Here the infinitive phrase is associated with
the noun <i>resolution</i>, but instead of defining or qualifying
<i>resolution</i>, it tells exactly what the resolution is, and so is
used as a noun. Moreover, we can make a sentence by
putting the verb <i>is</i> between the noun <i>resolution</i> and the
infinitive phrase; as, “His resolution is to defend the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</span>
tower,” etc. This sentence is true, and means that the
subject and the complement of the verb are two names for
the same thing. When the infinitive is used with the
noun as an adjective we cannot make such a sentence as
the above; for example, we cannot say <i>men are to listen</i>,
meaning that <i>men</i> and <i>to listen</i> are equivalent. Of course
few nouns can be explained by an infinitive in apposition;
no such noun, for instance, as <i>city</i>, <i>man</i>, <i>book</i>, <i>tree</i>,
but such nouns as <i>wish</i>, <i>promise</i>, <i>luck</i>, <i>intention</i>, <i>task</i>.</p>

<p>This use of the infinitive reminds us of a substantive
clause in apposition. In fact, both the adjective infinitive
and the appositive are substitutes for clauses, the
former taking the place of a restrictive adjective clause,
the latter of either an unrestrictive adjective clause or a
substantive clause.</p>

<p>In the sentence, “This is a day <i>on which to travel</i>,” we
have an infinitive phrase made from an adjective clause
and still retaining the relative pronoun. The relative
has an antecedent but does not join to it as usual a dependent
proposition.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—When we say that an infinitive is used as an adjective
or a noun, we do not mean for an instant that it takes the place of
any adjective or noun in the language. So far from this being the
case, the infinitive is employed simply because there are no nouns
or adjectives to say what the infinitive says for us.</p>
</div>

<p>II. The infinitive may be related to a verb in various
ways.</p>

<p>1. As subject; as, “<i>To pass this bridge</i> was the severest
trial.”—<i>Irving.</i> If we ask, what was the severest
trial? the answer is the whole phrase, <i>to pass this bridge</i>;
but the base of this phrase is the infinitive <i>to pass</i>, hence
it is the essential subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</span></p>

<p>A common way of using the infinitive as subject is
that arrangement by means of the anticipative subject <i>it</i>,
which enables us to put the real subject after the verb;
as, “It is a most earnest thing to be alive in this world.”—<i>Carlyle.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Some grammarians prefer to call <i>it</i> a neuter personal
pronoun, subject of the verb, and the infinitive its appositive, or explanatory
modifier.</p>
</div>

<p>2. As complement.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Object of a transitive verb. Not all transitive
verbs can take infinitives for objects. Most of those that
do are verbs denoting some activity of the feelings or the
will; as, “He <i>resolved</i> to go”; “They <i>hoped</i> to surprise
this post.” The infinitives here answer the questions, resolved
what? hoped what? They are equivalent to substantive
clauses,—He resolved <i>that he would go</i>, they
hoped <i>that they might surprise this post</i>; but when the
action denoted by the infinitive is to be performed by the
same person as that denoted by the subject of the predicate
verb, the infinitive is chosen instead of the clause.
It is simpler than the clause and has become by frequent
use equally clear. When the two actors are different,
two subjects must be expressed, hence the clause is employed;
for example, They resolved that <i>I</i> should go;
They hoped that <i>their allies</i> would surprise this post.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The contraction of a noun clause to an infinitive phrase
is very evident in such a sentence as this,—“He did not know <i>what
to say</i>.” The word <i>what</i> leads us to expect a subject and predicate
to follow, but we have merely an infinitive. The second subject if
expressed would be <i>he</i>, the same as that of the principal verb.</p>
</div>

<p>Verbs signifying <i>begin</i>, <i>continue</i>, or <i>cease</i> frequently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</span>
take an infinitive for object; as, “As he approached the
stream, his heart began <i>to thump</i>.”—<i>Irving.</i></p>

<p>The verb <i>ought</i> is always followed by an infinitive,
which is clearly seen to be its object when we remember
that <i>ought</i> is an old past tense of the verb <i>owe</i>; as, “The
founder of this stately mansion ought surely to have
stood in his own hall and to have offered the first welcome
to so many eminent personages.”—<i>Hawthorne.</i>
Here the obligation owed by the founder is specified by
the two infinitive phrases.</p>

<p>A use similar to the above is that of the infinitive after
<i>have</i>; as, “My friend, the Poet, tells, me he has to leave
town whenever the anniversaries come round.”—<i>Holmes.</i>
<i>Have</i> means <i>to possess</i>, or <i>be under an obligation</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The construction, “I had rather go than stay,” may be
explained by treating <i>go</i> as an infinitive without the sign <i>to</i> used as
object of the transitive verb <i>had</i>. Expanded the sentence reads,
“I had to go rather than I had to stay.” The constructions, “I had
sooner go than stay,” and, “I had as lief go as stay,” may be explained
in the same way.</p>
</div>

<p>After <i>dare</i>, <i>need</i>, and <i>please</i> the sign of the infinitive
<i>to</i> is usually omitted; for example, “I dare <i>do</i> all that
may become a man.” <i>Dare</i> and <i>need</i> are often used with
a subject in the third person singular, whereas we should
expect <i>dares</i> and <i>needs</i>; thus, “He need not be angry
about it.”</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) As part of a double object of a transitive verb.
We have just said that if one person <i>resolves</i> that another
person shall act, or <i>hopes</i> he will, the fact may be told by
using a substantive clause; as, “I resolved that John
should go.” But if I expected that John would go I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</span>
could tell it by using an infinitive; thus, “I expected
<i>John to go</i>.” This is a matter settled by usage; some
verbs must be followed by a clause object, while others
may be followed by a noun and an infinitive. We call
the noun (or pronoun) and the infinitive a double object.
It is not two objects; it is one object the same as
a clause, but it consists of two essential parts closely
related. The logical relation between <i>John</i> and <i>to go</i> in
the sentence above is that of subject and predicate; but
grammatically <i>to go</i> cannot be a predicate because the
infinitive does not assert. In this construction the infinitive
is related first to the noun <i>John</i> and then together
with <i>John</i> to the transitive verb <i>expected</i>. Sufficient
proof that the two elements <i>John</i> and <i>to go</i> constitute the
one direct object of <i>expected</i> is found in the fact that it
takes both of them to answer the question <i>expected what?</i>
For we did not expect John, nor did we expect to go.
Furthermore, the two elements may be changed to the
equivalent noun clause, <i>that John would go</i>, in which
<i>John</i> becomes subject and the infinitive becomes a finite
verb, the predicate of <i>John</i>.</p>

<p>This use must be carefully distinguished from that of
the infinitive in such a sentence as this,—“He bought
apples to eat.” Here <i>apples</i> alone answers the question
<i>bought what?</i> It is also plain that the relation between
<i>apples</i> and <i>to eat</i> is not that of subject and predicate.
Besides, if this sentence were expanded, merely the infinitive
would be changed to a clause. This might be an
adverbial clause,—“He bought apples <i>that he might
eat them</i>”; or an adjective clause,—“He bought apples
<i>that were good for eating</i>.”</p>

<p>Another sentence not so easily discriminated is this.—“I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</span>
told John to go.” Here there is what seems to be
a double object, but in reality <i>to go</i> is the direct object
and <i>John</i> is an indirect object, as in the sentence, “I told
John a story.” If we recast the sentence, employing a
substantive clause, we have,—“I told John that he
should go,” where <i>John</i> remains as indirect object and
the infinitive alone is expanded to the object clause. It
is the same often after such a verb as <i>order</i>; for example,
“He ordered the men to march”; but in the sentence,
“He ordered the message to be sent,” there is a true
double object. <i>Men</i> is indirect object, because it names
those to whom the order was given, but <i>message</i> does not
name anything to which an order was given,—it merely
tells what was to be sent. The sentences expanded read,—“He
ordered the men that they should march,” and
“He ordered that the message should be sent.”</p>

<p>We may conclude that when verbs with the notion of
<i>telling</i> in them, as <i>urge</i>, <i>beg</i>, <i>entreat</i>, <i>persuade</i>, etc., are
followed by a personal word and an infinitive,—as,
“He urged me to go,” we must carefully determine
whether the personal word is more closely related to the
predicate verb or to the infinitive. If we find it more
closely related to the predicate verb, we must call it an
indirect object, and say that the infinitive needs no word
for subject because it is understood that the subject of the
infinitive is the same word as that used for indirect
object.</p>

<p>The verbs most commonly followed by the double object
are,—(<i>a</i>) verbs of perception, like <i>see</i>, <i>hear</i>, <i>notice</i>;
for example, “Then, on either hand, I saw stately palaces
rise gray and lofty from the dark waters.”—<i>Howells</i>;
(<i>b</i>) verbs of permitting or causing, like <i>make</i>, <i>have</i>, <i>let</i>;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</span>
as, “‘Why, what would you have me do with you?’ said
the man.”—<i>Froude</i>; (<i>c</i>) verbs of feeling, like <i>wish</i>, <i>desire</i>,
<i>expect</i>; as, “Why, they all want him to get up and
make speeches, or songs, or toasts.”—<i>Holmes.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) As complement of an intransitive verb; as, “The
art of reading is <i>to skip judiciously</i>.”—<i>Hamerton.</i>
“For a long time the house has been <i>to let</i>.”—<i>Barrie.</i>
The infinitive is plainly a completing term in both cases,
but in the first it denotes identity with the subject, hence
has the use of a noun complement; while in the second
it tells the condition of the house, like the word <i>vacant</i>,
and hence has the use of a predicate adjective. Sometimes
it is possible to change the infinitive to an equivalent
adjective; as, “The accident is <i>to be deplored</i>,” or,
“is <i>deplorable</i>.”</p>

<p><i>Seem</i> and <i>appear</i> as well as forms of the verb <i>be</i> are
followed by this adjective infinitive. It is especially useful
in denoting an action that is to take place in the
future; thus, “He is to come soon.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Some of the difficulty in disposing of infinitives is due
to an attempt to speak of them in terms that apply to certain parts
of speech. Sometimes this seems forced. For instance, in the sentence,
“He seemed to tremble,” pupils are told to consider the infinitive
as a predicate adjective, when it does not seem to them to
bear much resemblance to an adjective.</p>

<p>What the pupils must see is this,—that <i>to tremble</i> completes
<i>seem</i> and tells something about the subject <i>he</i>. The following sentences
may be given,—“He seems a coward,” “He seems afraid,”
“He seems to tremble.” The verb in each case has a subjective
complement, but in one case this complement is a noun, in another
an adjective, in another an infinitive, the choice depending wholly
on the special meaning to be brought out. If the use of <i>to tremble</i>
seems to the pupil sufficiently like that of <i>afraid</i> to warrant his
calling it a predicate adjective, let him do so. If not, let him not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</span>
try to name it, but say of it instead that it completes the verb and
tells something about the subject.</p>
</div>

<p>The infinitive complement of a passive verb belongs
here; for example, “The human voice may be made <i>to
attain a wondrous strength and richness of tone</i>.”—<i>Brook.</i>
This construction often arises from changing a
sentence containing a double object into the passive form.
In the active voice the sentence just quoted reads,—“We
may make the human voice attain a wondrous
strength, etc.” Notice that the passive construction has
the advantage over the active in this respect, that it
enables us to avoid telling <i>who</i> makes. This is especially
convenient with the verb <i>say</i>. In the sentence, “He was
said to have stolen the money,” no one is charged with
having said that he stole.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The familiar expressions, “That is to say,” “It came to
pass,” “I came to know him,” also belong here; <i>came</i> is used in
the sense of <i>became</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>3. As an adverbial modifier of the verb. The infinitive
is very often joined to a verb to denote purpose; as,
“The salmon winters in the ocean, but in spring ascends
the fresh water rivers <i>to spawn</i>, or <i>lay its eggs</i>.” Sometimes
this infinitive is introduced by <i>so as</i> or <i>in order</i>. It
has almost entirely displaced the adverbial clause of purpose.</p>

<p>The infinitive may also denote the result of an action;
as, “His half worn shoes would wait until his small
brother grew <i>to fit them</i>.”—<i>Holmes.</i></p>

<p>In the following sentence from Barrie, “Leeby returned
panting <i>to say that the doctor might be expected
in an hour</i>,” the infinitive seems to be employed instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</span>
of another finite verb, for the meaning is not that Leeby
returned in order to say, but rather that Leeby returned
<i>and</i> said. In the sentence, He went home <i>only to die</i>, the
infinitive denotes neither the purpose nor the result of
his going home, but only a subsequent action. It might
be preferable in such cases to call the infinitive an accompaniment
of the verb rather than a modifier.</p>

<p>In this sentence from Holmes, “I grieve <i>to say it</i>, but
our people, I think, have not generally agreeable voices,”
<i>to say it</i> denotes the cause of my grieving.</p>

<p>In this sentence from Henry James, “He must have
been an American, <i>to take the picturesque so prodigiously
to heart</i>,” the infinitive phrase is the equivalent of an
adverbial clause of reason, telling on what ground the
main assertion rests.</p>

<p>The infinitive may also denote condition, or manner;
for example, “You must have the imagination of a poet
<i>to transfigure them</i>,” and, “Is everything going <i>to suit
you</i>?” In the former sentence the infinitive phrase is
equivalent to the clause, <i>if you transfigure them</i>. In
the latter it tells <i>how</i> things are going on. In fact, this
useful little element may accompany a predicate verb
to denote almost all the relations denoted by adverbial
clauses.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is difficult to decide whether an infinitive
is a complement or a modifier. Perhaps the best way
to settle the point is to ascertain what the infinitive is
equivalent to, or what question it answers; for example,
“If you continue your observations, you will not fail to
notice that the speed of its disappearance depends on the
character of the day.”—<i>Tyndall.</i> Here the infinitive
answers the question, <i>fail in what respect?</i> and is equivalent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</span>
to the phrase, <i>in noticing</i>. It is well, then, to consider
it an adverbial modifier.</p>

<p>Perhaps the infinitive is used after no other verbs
oftener than after <i>go</i> and <i>use</i>, as in the sentences, “I am
going to stay until you are tired of me”; “I used to
wonder what this might be.” Both <i>go</i> and <i>use</i> are intransitive
verbs, but the infinitives can hardly be described
as their modifiers, for the predication lies more in
the infinitive than in the finite verbs, <i>am going</i> or <i>used</i>.
The verb <i>am going</i> makes the action denoted by the infinitive
intentional, and <i>used</i> makes it customary. Such
predicates as <i>am going to stay</i> and <i>used to wonder</i> should
be described either as idiomatic verb-phrases, or as consisting
of an intransitive verb and an infinitive, without
any attempt to establish a complementary or modifying
relation between the infinitive and the verb.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The verb <i>be</i> is sometimes used in the sense of <i>go</i> or
<i>come</i>, and may then be modified by an infinitive of purpose, as in
the sentence,—“The old Master was talking about a concert he
had been to hear.”—<i>Holmes.</i></p>
</div>

<p>III. The infinitive may be associated with an adjective
or an adverb.</p>

<p>A construction often met is a predicate adjective followed
by an infinitive, especially such adjectives as <i>sure</i>,
<i>glad</i>, <i>sorry</i>, <i>apt</i>, <i>anxious</i>. The infinitives answer such
questions as <i>sure of what?</i> <i>anxious about what?</i> and so
limit the meaning of the adjective; for example, “We
are right willing and able to work.”—<i>Carlyle.</i> “He
was careful to acquaint himself with the country.”</p>

<p>Often the adjective is first modified by the adverb
<i>enough</i> or <i>too</i>; thus, “This narrative is too significant
to be omitted.”—<i>Carlyle.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</span></p>

<p>When the adjective is first modified by <i>so</i>, the infinitive
is introduced by <i>as</i>, and takes the place of a
clause of result; as, “Be so kind <i>as to stand</i>.” Here the
infinitive is brought into the sentence by the adjective
<i>kind</i>, but as an infinitive of result, may be said to modify
the entire predicate <i>be so kind</i>.</p>

<p>The infinitive in this construction may also be associated
with an adverb; as, “He worked so swiftly as
to surprise us all.” We notice that it is easy to avoid
the clause here by substituting the infinitive, for the subject
of the clause is the same as the subject of the principal
verb.</p>

<p>An adjective in the comparative degree is often followed,
not by a clause of degree as we should expect, but
by an infinitive introduced by <i>than</i>; as, “He is wiser
than to make such a remark.” The infinitive phrase
modifies <i>wiser</i> and is joined to it by the subordinating
conjunction <i>than</i>.</p>

<p>IV. In addition to the foregoing constructions we occasionally
find the infinitive used as the object of a preposition.
The few prepositions governing infinitives are
<i>except</i>, <i>but</i>, and <i>save</i>, the two latter meaning <i>except</i>;
as, “Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself.”
Usually, <i>to</i>, the sign of the infinitive, is omitted
after these prepositions.</p>

<p>In the following sentences the preposition governing
an infinitive phrase is omitted.—“It’s worth quite a little
fortune to any man who gets it, and I understand that
there are more vacancies than there are men, so that the
trustees are at their wits’ end <i>what to do with the money</i>.”—<i>Conan
Doyle</i>. “I am somewhat at a loss <i>what to
think</i>.” The prepositional phrases <i>at their wits’ end</i> and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</span>
<i>at a loss</i> are complements of the verbs <i>are</i> and <i>am</i>, used
instead of adjectives because there are no equivalent adjectives.
The infinitive phrases answer the questions <i>at
their wits’ end about what?</i> and <i>at a loss about what?</i>
and so are best disposed of as objects of the preposition
<i>about</i> understood.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In the construction, “I am about to go,” <i>about</i> is usually
disposed of as a preposition governing the infinitive. Instead it
should be considered as an adverb modifying the infinitive, which is
the complement of <i>am</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>The preposition <i>for</i> may take a double object; thus,
“A space was left between them for <i>the garrison to pass
out</i>.” The answer to the question <i>for what?</i> is, <i>the garrison
to pass out</i>. Such a prepositional phrase is often
used as logical subject after the anticipative subject <i>it</i>;
thus, “It is not lawful for us to put any man to death.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In the common construction, “I cannot but think,” the
word <i>think</i> is an infinitive with <i>to</i> omitted, used as object of the
preposition <i>but</i>. There is an ellipsis in this construction which must
be supplied for analysis, unless we dispose of the whole expression
at once as an idiomatic verb-phrase. Supplying the ellipsis we have,
“I cannot do anything but think.”</p>

<p>The expression, “I can but think” is best disposed of now as
equivalent to “I can only think,” for that is what it signifies to us.
The verb then is <i>can think</i>, and <i>but</i> is its adverbial modifier.</p>
</div>

<p>V. The infinitive may be used independently, having
no grammatical relation to any other word in the sentence;
thus, “<i>To tell you the truth</i>, my errand is not so
much to buy as to borrow.”—<i>George Eliot</i>. Certain
stereotyped phrases are used in this way, such as <i>to be
sure</i>, <i>to speak plainly</i>, <i>to make a long story short</i>. They
are useful to express in few words what in other more
regular constructions it would take many words to say.</p>

<p>In this sentence of Hale’s, “This sort of vagueness,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</span>
<i>not to say misapprehension</i>, affects the question, Who
are our Leaders?” we have an independent infinitive
phrase which adds much to the meaning of the sentence.
It tells us here that the author uses the noun <i>vagueness</i>
so as to be on the safe side, but in his opinion <i>misapprehension</i>
is the more precise term.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—An independent expression very similar to the one just
given is found in the following sentence,—“It appeals to our more
purely human, <i>one might almost say domestic</i>, qualities.”—<i>Lowell.</i></p>

<p class="c sp">THE PARTICIPIAL PHRASE</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> participle has been defined by grammarians as
a verbal adjective. They do not mean that it limits or
qualifies the meaning of a noun as an adjective does.
Very few participles do that. They mean only that it is
brought into the sentence for the purpose of telling something
about some noun. It is not usually so close a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</span>
modifier of the noun, either in relation or position, as
many other noun adjuncts are; often it is so loosely
joined to its noun as to seem almost like a parenthetical
element. When the noun it modifies is the subject of
the sentence, then the great importance of the participle
as a sentence-element lies in the fact that it is a convenient
means of avoiding a predication.</p>

<p><b>Participial Forms.</b>—The participial forms of the transitive
verb are six.</p>

<p>
<i>Active</i>—Seeing, having seen.<br>
<i>Active progressive</i>—Having been seeing.<br>
<i>Passive</i>—Being seen, seen, having been seen.<br>
</p>

<p>The participles of the intransitive verb are four.</p>

<p>
<i>Common form</i>—Going, gone, having gone.<br>
<i>Progressive</i>—Having been going.<br>
</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—We frequently meet these combinations of words: <i>being
gone</i>, <i>having been gone</i>. They are not passive participles of the
verb <i>go</i>, for they do not denote action received any more than do
the phrases <i>being sick</i> and <i>having been sick</i>. The word <i>gone</i> is a
participle used as an adjective complement of the participles <i>being</i>
and <i>having been</i>, just as the word <i>sick</i> is used. This is a very common
construction, seen in such familiar sentences as the following,—He
<i>is risen</i>, the tree <i>is fallen</i>, the coat <i>is</i> badly <i>worn</i>, you <i>are mistaken</i>,
the meat <i>is done</i>. In all these instances the participles denote
a condition of the subject, and are therefore complements of the verb.</p>
</div>

<p>The most common use of the simple participial forms,
like <i>seeing</i> and <i>seen</i>, is to help form progressive verb-phrases
and passive verb-phrases; thus, <i>is seeing</i>, <i>shall be
seeing</i>, <i>might have been seeing</i>; <i>is seen</i>, <i>shall be seen</i>,
<i>might have been seen</i>. These phrases are not to be separated
into their constituent parts, however, but are to be
treated as single verbs, hence we are not concerned with
the participles they contain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</span></p>



<p><b>Uses of the Participle.</b>—1. The participial adjective.—The
one use of the participle which is almost identical
with that of the adjective is seen in such expressions
as <i>running</i> water, <i>trotting</i> horse, <i>educated</i> man, <i>spoiled</i>
child. Here the idea Of action is not so prominent as
that of quality. Some of these participles have become
so far like adjectives as to admit of comparison; for
example, <i>striking</i> in such an expression as <i>striking appearance</i>,
or <i>deceiving</i> in <i>deceiving story</i>. Some of them,
too, may be modified by <i>very</i>, which is never a verb
modifier; as, <i>loving</i> in <i>very loving children</i>.</p>

<p>This participle is sometimes used substantively; thus,
“The <i>loving</i> are the <i>daring</i>.” “The <i>slain</i> were left to
die.” Of course such a word as <i>people</i> is understood
after these participles, and in analyzing these sentences it
may be supplied if one so desires, but it is no more necessary
than it is in the sentences,—“The <i>good</i> are happy,
the <i>righteous</i> are blessed,” where a qualifying adjective
is used as a noun.</p>

<p>2. The participial phrase as a substitute for a proposition.—We
come now to those frequent and important
uses of the participle where it saves a predication. It
usually has other words associated with it, either as complement
or modifiers, the whole group forming a participial
phrase.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The participial phrase may take the place of an
adjective clause; as, “The use of the cartridges <i>complained
of</i> was discontinued by orders issued in January
1857.”—<i>McCarthy.</i> The participle is here equivalent
to a restrictive adjective clause pointing out the particular
cartridges.</p>

<p>Just as often the participial phrase is equivalent to an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</span>
unrestrictive clause, and then it is very much like an
appositive modifier; as, “The first person I met was a
poor old woman, <i>a little bowed down with age, gathering
grapes into a large basket</i>.”—<i>Longfellow.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The participial phrase may take the place of an
adverbial clause; as, “And, <i>having once tasted a life like
this</i>, he could no more return to what he had left behind
him.”—<i>Boyesen.</i> Here the participial phrase tells us
<i>why</i> he could no more return to what he had left behind
him. If this idea were differently expressed, we should
have either a prepositional phrase modifying the predicate
or an adverbial clause of cause introduced by <i>since</i>.
But all this does not make the phrase a grammatical adjunct
of the predicate. Instead it is an adjunct of the subject
<i>he</i>. If it were expanded into a clause, the subject <i>he</i>
would have to be supplied and the phrase would become
a predicate. Now, as predicate it would tell something
about the subject <i>he</i>; and it does not cease to do this
when it is changed to a participial phrase.</p>

<p>In the following sentence from Geikie,—“<i>Entering
the polluted Temple space, and gazing round on the
tumult and manifold defilement</i>, He could not remain impassive,”
the phrase is plainly equivalent in meaning to
an adverbial clause, telling <i>when</i> (and in some degree
<i>why</i>) he could not remain impassive. But grammatically
the phrase is an adjunct of the subject <i>He</i>.</p>

<p>Lest it should not be perfectly clear to the reader what
particular relation the participial phrase is intended to
denote, the author often indicates the relation by the same
conjunction that he would use to introduce an adverbial
clause; as, “But we must above all other things take into
account, <i>when considering the position of the Hindoo</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</span>
<i>Sepoy</i>, the influence of the tremendous institution of
caste.”—<i>McCarthy.</i> Without <i>when</i> the reader’s first
thought would be that the phrase denotes cause.</p>

<p>In this sentence from Cooper,—“But the vessels of
which we write, <i>though constructed at so remote a period</i>,
would have done credit to the improvements of our own
time,” the concessive phrase might have been interpreted
as causal, if <i>though</i> had not been inserted.</p>

<p>In this sentence from Hamlin Garland,—“Each soul
was solemn, <i>as if facing the Maker of the world</i>,” the fact
that the phrase denotes manner is made evident by the
conjunction <i>as if</i>. Any conjunction used like <i>when</i>,
<i>though</i>, <i>as if</i> in the sentences quoted, may be said to introduce
the participial phrase and to indicate its relation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In all such sentences as the above, where the participial
phrase is introduced by a subordinating conjunction, it is perfectly
proper, before analyzing, to supply the words necessary to make the
participial phrase into an adverbial clause. It is more satisfactory, indeed,
to do this except in a few cases where such an expansion gives
a verb that does not harmonize in tense or form of conjugation
with the verb in the principal proposition; for example, “Though
holding no office and steadily refusing an election to the Storthing,
he has been the life and soul of the liberal party.”—<i>Boyesen.</i> Here
the concord of tenses would call for <i>has held</i> and <i>has refused</i> in
the concessive clause instead of the progressive verb-phrases <i>has
been holding</i> and <i>has been refusing</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The absolute phrase as a substitute for a <i>dependent</i>
proposition.—In all the preceding examples the
substitution of a participial phrase for a clause was made
easy by the fact that the subject of the clause was the
same as the subject of the principal proposition. When
the subject is not the same, the clause is condensed into
what has been termed an <i>absolute phrase</i>; as, “Nature,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</span>
<i>her patience with him being ended</i>, leaves him desolate.”—<i>Carlyle.</i></p>

<p>The absolute phrase consists essentially of a substantive
and a participle, having to each other the logical relation
of subject and predicate. In the sentence quoted the
phrase is equivalent to the adverbial clause of cause, <i>because
her patience with him is ended</i>. The absolute
phrase is usually said to be grammatically independent,
but it is so frequently used as to be a regular English
construction now, and as such may be said to modify the
predicate of the principal proposition.</p>

<p>Notice that it is not a <i>participial</i> phrase that modifies
the predicate; it is an <i>absolute</i> phrase. The participial
phrase is only one of the two equal parts of the absolute
phrase; it can hardly be said to modify the noun, which is
the other part, but it stands side by side with the noun to
make an absolute phrase.</p>

<p>The absolute phrase denotes other relations than that
of cause. The most common are concession and time;
as, “Was Oliver Cromwell, <i>his bitterest enemies themselves
being judges</i>, destitute of private virtues?”—<i>Macaulay.</i>
“<i>Night coming on</i>, they broke the bolts of
the Town gates.”—<i>Carlyle.</i></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The chief use of the absolute phrase is to take the
place of an independent proposition; thus, “A child of
three sat up in his crib and screamed at the top of his
voice, <i>his fists clinched</i> and <i>his eyes full of terror</i>.”—<i>Kipling.</i>
Here the absolute phrases have no relation of
time, cause, concession, etc., to the principal proposition,
hence are not modifiers. If expanded into propositions
these phrases would only add coördinate thoughts to the
first one—“<i>His fists were clinched</i>,” and “<i>his eyes</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</span>
<i>were full of terror</i>.” It is best to call such phrases accompaniments
of the predicate instead of modifiers.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—From the sentence just quoted we learn that the absolute
phrase does not always contain a participle; it may consist of a substantive
and an adjective, as in <i>his eyes full of terror</i>. We also find
absolute phrases in which a prepositional phrase takes the place of
the participle; as, “He left my side, <i>a summer bloom on his fair
cheeks</i>, a smile parting his innocent lips.”—<i>Miss Mitford.</i></p>

<p>It is even possible to make an absolute phrase of two substantives
as, “Hargreaves and Arkwright, <i>both Englishmen</i>, invented and
improved spinning and weaving machinery.”</p>

<p>It would be proper to supply the participle <i>being</i> before either the
adjective, the prepositional phrase, or the noun, but it is best to dispose
of constructions just as we find them.</p>
</div>

<p>A construction parallel to the absolute phrase is found
in the sentence, “Half way up the hill he met Bagheera
<i>with the morning dew shining like moonstones on his
coat</i>.”—<i>Kipling.</i> Here the object of the preposition
<i>with</i> is the whole group of words following it, and of this
group the base-words are the noun <i>dew</i> and the participle
<i>shining</i>, which have the logical relation of subject and
predicate. This is a very common construction after the
prepositions <i>with</i> and <i>without</i>.</p>

<p>3. The participial phrase often takes the place not of
a whole proposition but only of a predicate; for example,
“Westward on the banks of the Thames, the towers of
Westminster Abbey stand <i>guarding the ashes of England’s
greatest men</i>.” The meaning here is, the towers
stand <i>and</i> guard; but by means of the participle one of
these predicates is subordinated to the other. The participial
phrase is not so much a complement of the verb
<i>stand</i> as an accompaniment of it; at the same time it
tells an attribute of the subject.</p>

<p>A construction seemingly like the one just given, but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</span>
in reality different, is found after verbs of <i>going</i> or
<i>coming</i>. These verbs may be followed by participles
which tell not an accompanying action, but how the going
or coming is accomplished; as, “Sometimes a wandering
leaf came <i>floating and wavering downward</i>, and settled
on the water.”—<i>Longfellow.</i> This does not mean that
the leaf came <i>and</i> floated <i>and</i> wavered, but only that it
floated and wavered, and these actions were the means
of its coming. Such a participle is truly a modifier of
the verb.</p>

<p>4. The participle as part of a double object.—After
a few verbs like <i>keep</i>, <i>find</i>, <i>see</i>, <i>hear</i>, <i>feel</i>, <i>have</i>, we find
the participle taking the place of the infinitive in a double
object. The participle is almost always chosen when a
passive construction is needed; as, “The saddle fell to
earth, and he heard <i>it trampled</i> under-foot by his pursuer.”—<i>Irving.</i>
When the active construction is called
for, the advantage of the participle over the infinitive is
that it gives the idea of longer continuance of the action;
as, “Just then he heard <i>the black steed panting</i> and <i>blowing</i>
close behind him.”—<i>Irving.</i></p>

<p>The expression <i>kept me waiting</i> is grammatically
equivalent to <i>made me wait</i>.</p>

<p>5. There are two constructions of the participle that
are quite different from any of those cited, being deviations
from its ordinary use.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The participle used adverbially to denote degree;
thus, <i>boiling</i> hot, <i>stinging</i> cold, <i>dripping</i> wet. Here the
participles unmistakably modify adjectives.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The participle used independently; thus, “<i>Speaking
of those yellow squash-bugs</i>, I think I disheartened
them by covering the plants so deep with soot and wood-ashes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</span>
that they could not find them.”—<i>Warner.</i> This
participial phrase corresponds to the infinitive phrase
used independently, though it is more rarely met.</p>

</div>

<p class="c sp">THE GERUND</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> gerund, or infinitive in <i>-ing</i>, is substantive in its
nature, for like the root infinitive it <i>names</i> the action or
state asserted by the verb. It is not so easily identified
in the sentence as the root infinitive, however, for in form
it is precisely like the participle, from which it has to be
distinguished entirely by its use.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</span></p>

<p><b>The forms of the gerund</b> are shown in the following
examples:—</p>

<p>1. The transitive verb <i>see</i>:</p>

<p class="la">
Active—seeing, having seen.<br>
Active progressive—having been seeing.<br>
Passive—being seen, having been seen.
</p>

<p>2. The intransitive verb <i>rise</i>:</p>

<p class="la">
Common form—rising, having risen.<br>
Progressive form—having been rising.
</p>

<p><b>The use of the gerund</b> is almost entirely restricted to
that of the noun. When found without adjuncts it does
not materially differ from the noun; for example, <i>Painting</i>
is a fine art. But usually the verb-nature of the
gerund is prominent as well as its noun-use, for usually
it is accompanied by a complement or adverbial modifiers;
as, “The need of <i>feeling responsible all the livelong day</i>
has been preached long enough in our New England.”—<i>Wm.
James.</i> The gerund together with its adjuncts
forms a gerund-phrase. It has certain advantages over
the root infinitive. In many places it is preferable because
it gives the idea of an action in progress. It is
also employed in relation to some words where usage
does not permit the root infinitive. Furthermore, its
substantive nature comes out more prominently than that
of the root infinitive, for like the noun it may be modified
by an article or a possessive; thus, “Pascal said that most
of the evils of life arose from <i>man’s being unable to sit
still in a room</i>.”—<i>Bagehot.</i></p>

<p>I. The gerund used as a noun.</p>

<p>1. Subject of a verb; as, “<i>Lying in bed and listening
to their dreary music</i> had a pleasure in it.”—<i>Holmes.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</span></p>

<p>2. Object of a verb; as, “I remember <i>being told that
it was the sound of the waves</i>.”—<i>Holmes.</i></p>

<p>3. Objective complement; as, “If a child finds itself
in want of anything it runs in and asks its father for it—does
it call that <i>doing its father a service</i>?”—<i>Ruskin.</i>
Here the gerund phrase helps to complete the verb <i>does
call</i> and at the same time is an attribute of the direct object
<i>that</i>.</p>

<p>4. Subjective complement; as, “The first of all English
games is <i>making money</i>.”—<i>Ruskin.</i></p>

<p>5. Appositive modifier; as, “I recommend this most
faithful form of reading—<i>learning by heart</i>.”</p>

<p>6. Object of a preposition; as, “Nelson attributed all
his success in life to <i>having been a quarter of an hour
before his time</i>.” This is the commonest use of the
gerund, for while the root infinitive may be used after
very few prepositions, the gerund may be used after many.</p>

<p>7. Objective adverbial.—The adjective <i>worth</i> is usually
followed by a noun that expresses a measure of value,
answering the question <i>worth how much?</i> or <i>worth what?</i>
It may be followed by a gerund answering the same question;
as, “That is worth <i>paying for</i>.”—<i>Warner.</i></p>

<p>II. The gerund used adjectively.—We find the gerund
used adjectively in such expressions as <i>sleeping</i>-car,
<i>mourning</i>-robes, <i>dining</i>-table, <i>eating</i>-apples. These
gerunds seem at first like the participles in such expressions
as <i>singing</i>-bird, <i>shooting</i>-star, <i>barking</i>-dog; but
they are not like participles in meaning, as can be proved
by changing them to equivalent elements of other kinds.
A singing-bird is a bird <i>that sings</i>, but a sleeping-car is
not a car that sleeps; it is a car <i>for sleeping in</i>.</p>

<p><b>Peculiar Constructions.</b>—It cannot always be settled
to one’s entire satisfaction whether a certain element is a
participle or a gerund. In order to decide one must know
just how a certain expression came to be, that is, of what
earlier and older form it is a development. Sometimes it
seems impossible to ascertain this. For instance, take the
sentence, “Nanny has been busy ironing this evening.”—<i>George
Eliot.</i> Is <i>ironing</i> a participle, and does the order
of words in this sentence arise from a transposition of
the sentence,—“Nanny, ironing, has been busy this
evening”? Or is <i>ironing</i> a gerund, and is this sentence a
parallel construction with, “Nanny has been busy <i>at her
ironing</i> this evening”? Either interpretation of the
sentence is a sensible one.</p>

<p>Another puzzling instance is found in the sentence,—“He
was two weeks learning to use his flippers.”—<i>Kipling.</i>
Is <i>learning</i> a part of the progressive verb-phrase
<i>was learning</i>, and does the sentence mean, “He
was learning to use his flippers during two weeks”? Or
is <i>learning</i> a gerund, object of <i>at</i> understood, that is, is
the sentence a parallel construction with this,—“You
were a long time <i>at it</i>”? One cannot pronounce with
certainty on this point, but must choose the construction
that seems to him most reasonable.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE PREPOSITIONAL PHRASE</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—No other sentence-element is more frequently
employed or more useful for the precise expression
of thought than the prepositional phrase. By
its aid we can define exactly the scope of a noun, a verb,
or an adjective. This is due not to the great number of
prepositions in the English language, for there are not a
hundred in all, but to the many different relations that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</span>
may be denoted by one preposition. A striking illustration
of this is found in the following sentence:</p>

<p>“One of the useful and grateful tasks of historians and
biographers is to bring forward to the eye of every new
generation of men and women those illustrious characters
who made a great figure in the days of their grandfathers
and grandmothers, yet who have nearly faded out of sight
in the rush of new events and interests, and the rise of
new stars in the intellectual firmament.”—<i>Lord.</i></p>

<p>Here we find the preposition <i>of</i> used eight times and
expressing almost as many different relations. The first
of-phrase, <i>of the useful and grateful tasks of historians
and biographers</i>, serves to point out the whole group or
class of things from which the one thing talked about is
selected. The second phrase, <i>of historians and biographers</i>,
limits <i>tasks</i> by telling who performed these tasks.
The third phrase <i>of every new generation of men and
women</i>, limits <i>eyes</i> by telling whose eyes are meant. The
fourth phrase, <i>of men and women</i>, limits the application
of the noun <i>generation</i> to human beings only, and brings
in the nouns <i>men</i> and <i>women</i> to serve as antecedents of
the pronoun <i>their</i> later in the sentence. The fifth phrase,
<i>of their grandfathers and grandmothers</i>, specifies what
days by locating them in the past. The sixth phrase <i>out
of sight</i>, has the preposition <i>of</i> reinforced by <i>out</i> so that
the two words are equivalent to <i>from</i>, and thus the phrase
denotes not only place but movement away from it. The
seventh phrase, <i>of new events and interests</i>, and the
eighth, <i>of new stars</i>, are alike in function; they tell what
things <i>rush</i> and <i>rise</i>.</p>

<p>Every one of these phrases except <i>out of sight</i> modifies
a noun; but just as often a phrase introduced by <i>of</i> modifies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</span>
a verb or an adjective. As soon as we hear the adjectives
<i>capable</i>, <i>full</i>, <i>glad</i>, <i>jealous</i>, <i>proud</i>, <i>rid</i>, <i>sure</i>,
<i>weary</i>, do we not expect an answer to the question, <i>capable
of what? full of what? glad of what?</i> etc. And do we
not usually find such verbs as <i>borrow</i>, <i>buy</i>, <i>complain</i>,
<i>cure</i>, <i>make</i>, <i>smell</i>, <i>speak</i>, <i>taste</i>, <i>tell</i>, <i>think</i>, <i>warn</i>, followed
by an of-phrase?</p>

<p>What is true of the extensive use of <i>of</i> is no less true of
other prepositions,—<i>at</i>, <i>by</i>, <i>from</i>, <i>in</i>, <i>on</i>, <i>to</i>, <i>with</i>; while
there are some whose use is much more limited,—<i>across</i>,
<i>after</i>, <i>before</i>, <i>up</i>, <i>toward</i>.</p>



<p><b>The Prepositional Phrase used Adjectively.</b>—We say
of prepositional phrases that they are adjective or adverbial,
according to what they modify—nouns, verbs,
or adjectives. We have seen from the sentence quoted
how freely the prepositional phrase may be joined to a
noun, and how many different relations it may express.
Let us see now what sentence-elements this adjective
prepositional phrase takes the place of.</p>

<p>In the following sentence from Geikie,—“The stay
of Jesus in Capernaum at this time was very short,” the
phrase <i>of Jesus</i> takes the place of the possessive noun
<i>Jesus’s</i>. It is better than the possessive here, not so
much because this particular possessive is an awkward
form as because <i>stay</i> is the more important word and
should have the prominent place at the beginning of the
sentence.</p>

<p>In Higginson’s sentence,—“Yet he has found readers
at all periods alike among men of thought and men of
action,” the phrases <i>of thought</i> and <i>of action</i> take the
place of the adjectives <i>thinking</i> and <i>active</i>. But the adjectives,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</span>
preceding their nouns, seem less important than
the nouns; while the phrases, coming after the nouns,
imply that the contrasted words <i>thought</i> and <i>action</i> contain
the more important ideas.</p>

<p>In Boyesen’s sentence,—“According to Norwegian
law at that time, every son of a king was entitled to his
share of the kingdom,” the phrase <i>at that time</i> is a substitute
for the clause, <i>which was operative at that time</i>;
but it is preferable, not only for brevity, but because it
makes the modifier less prominent,—it is not forced
upon the reader’s attention as it would be by a subject and
predicate.</p>

<p>We may well repeat here what was said in one of our
first chapters, that several different elements may be exact
equivalents before they are in a sentence, but as soon as
we desire to make use of one of them for the communication
of thought, they are not equivalent—one of them
will almost invariably serve our turn better than the other.
<i>Thinking</i> men, men <i>of thought</i>, men <i>who think</i> are identical
in meaning, but in a sentence the special setting of
these expressions, the accompanying ideas, will determine
which most clearly and precisely conveys our meaning
and should therefore be used.</p>

<p>Besides modifying a noun, the adjective prepositional
phrase may complete an intransitive verb; as, “My march
was <i>of long duration</i>.”—<i>Audubon.</i> “All these writers
are <i>of a revolutionary cast</i>.”—<i>De Quincey.</i> “All the
floors in Venice are <i>of stone</i>.”—<i>Howells.</i> In sentences
like these the phrase denotes an attribute of the subject.
It is usually employed because there is no adjective that
expresses so well the precise meaning.</p>

<p>The adjective <i>long</i>, if used in the first sentence quoted,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</span>
would imply that the march was long in space, in miles
traversed, but the phrase means only that it consumed
much time.</p>

<p>The adjective <i>revolutionary</i>, if used in the second sentence,
might be interpreted to mean that the writers belong
to a revolutionary period, or that they are decidedly
in favor of revolution; but the phrase means only that
they have a leaning toward revolutionary ideas.</p>

<p>In the third sentence the noun <i>stone</i> used adjectively
would be to the general reader an exact equivalent of the
phrase <i>of stone</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—Occasionally we find a prepositional phrase completing
a verb and seeming more like a noun complement than an adjective;
as, “A common means of transportation was <i>in clumsy carts drawn
by oxen going at the most but three or four miles an hour</i>.”—<i>Draper.</i></p>
</div>



<p><b>The Prepositional Phrase used Adverbially.</b>—The
prepositional phrase often modifies a verb or an adjective,
and may modify an adverb. As a verb modifier it may
denote the various relations denoted by clauses, though
place, time, and manner are the most common; as, “They
come in the summer months by hundreds and hundreds of
thousands out of the cold gray sea.”—<i>Kipling.</i> Here
we have three phrases modifying <i>come</i>, introduced by <i>in</i>,
<i>by</i>, and <i>out of</i>, and denoting respectively time, manner,
and place.</p>

<p>The prepositional phrase of place tells,—(<i>a</i>) where
an action occurs or a condition exists; as, “Herring appear
in immense schools <i>off the coast of Norway and the
northern shores of the British Isles</i>”; (<i>b</i>) whence an
action proceeds; (<i>c</i>) whither an action tends. Both of
these last we find in the sentence,—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</span></p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>From underneath an aged oak,</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>That slanted from an islet rock</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">A little skiff shot <i>to the bay</i>.”—<i>Scott.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The prepositional phrase of time may denote almost
all the relations denoted by the adverbial clause of time,
and several of the words used as conjunctions to introduce
those clauses, such as <i>after</i>, <i>before</i>, <i>since</i>, <i>till</i>, were originally
prepositions and are still employed as such.</p>

<p>The prepositional phrase of manner is found quite as
often as the adverb of manner; for example, “He had
fired with great rapidity yet with surprising accuracy.”
If adverbs had been used here the sentence would read,
“He had fired very rapidly yet surprisingly accurately.”
The combination of the last two adverbs is exceedingly
awkward.</p>

<p>When a prepositional phrase modifies an adjective it
generally serves to limit its application by denoting the
particular respect in which its meaning is to be considered;
thus, “Our fathers emerged from their arduous, protracted,
desolating Revolutionary struggle, rich indeed <i>in
hope</i>, but poor <i>in worldly goods</i>.”—<i>Greeley.</i> Here the
phrases tell in what particular our fathers were <i>rich</i> and
<i>poor</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—The prepositional phrase may modify the interjection
<i>alas</i>, which is equivalent to the assertion <i>I am sorry</i>; thus, “One
may believe that the golden age is behind us or before us, but alas
for the forlorn wisdom of him who rejects it altogether.”—<i>Higginson.</i></p>
</div>



<p><b>The Prepositional Phrase used Substantively.</b>—We
often find a prepositional phrase used as the object of a
preposition. This gives rise to a succession of two prepositions
like <i>from among</i>, <i>from beneath</i>, <i>until within</i>, <i>till</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</span>
<i>after</i>. Some grammarians treat these as one compound
preposition, but it seems to us best to consider them separately.</p>

<p>In the following sentence from Bolles,—“The river
came from between abrupt, rocky walls,” the phrase <i>between
abrupt, rocky walls</i> denotes a place that no noun in
the language names, hence the phrase is employed to name
the place, and as such a name it is the object of the preposition
<i>from</i>.</p>

<p>It is very common for the preposition <i>except</i> or <i>but</i>
(meaning <i>except</i>) to be followed by a prepositional phrase
used as its object; thus, “Nobody comes to Novastoshnah
except on business.”—<i>Kipling.</i> “No great art ever yet
rose on earth but among a nation of soldiers.”—<i>Ruskin.</i>
A phrase of this sort is usually preceded by some negative
expression, and is necessary to the truth of the sentence,
as it brings in a reservation or exception to some sweeping
negative statement.</p>



<p><b>The Prepositional Phrase in an Absolute Phrase.</b>—The
prepositional phrase, as we saw in Chapter XXI., is sometimes
used with a noun to form an absolute phrase. It
is not then an ordinary adjective modifier of the noun,
but is more like a predicated attribute, the verb being
omitted. It may be called an appositive modifier of the
noun; for example,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“’Tis written that the serving angels stand</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Beside God’s throne, <i>ten myriads on each hand</i>.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">—<i>E. Arnold.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>The participle is omitted from the absolute phrase in such
a sentence because it can readily be supplied by the reader
from the verb in the predicate. It is always mentally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</span>
supplied for the interpretation of the sentence, but it need
not be supplied for its analysis.</p>



<p><b>Object of a Preposition.</b>—The word or group of words
that is brought into relation to some other word by a
preposition is called the object of the preposition. It is
always a substantive, but not always a noun or pronoun.
Some of the common substitutes for the noun are the
gerund, the prepositional phrase, and the noun clause.
The prepositional phrase in this use we have just discussed.
The gerund and the noun clause were discussed
in Chapters XXII. and VII. respectively.</p>

<p>All of the above are regular constructions, but there
are a few peculiar stereotyped phrases in the language,
made up of a preposition and an adjective or adverb; as,
<i>from far</i>, <i>at all</i>, <i>at once</i>, <i>at the best</i>. It is wiser in such
a case not to separate the phrase into any component
parts, but to think of it and treat it as if it were one word.</p>

<p>Sometimes a preposition is associated with a verb or
verbal in such a way as not to require an object. Such a
construction is usually passive or infinitive; for example,
“I was going to say something about our boarders the
other day, when I got <i>run away with</i> by my local reminiscences.”—<i>Holmes.</i>
“Those who are still in a state
to require <i>being taken care of</i> by others must be protected
against their own actions as well as against external injury.”—<i>Mill.</i>
“One child in a household of grown
people <i>is</i> usually <i>made very much of</i>, and in a quiet way
I <i>was a good deal taken notice of</i> by Mrs. Bretton.”—<i>Brontë.</i></p>

<p>Prepositions so used may sometimes be considered as
adverbs, as in the expressions, <i>money to do with, firesides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</span>
to sit at</i>; but oftener it is impossible to separate
them from the verb-phrase or verbal-phrase of which they
form a part. They help to express the one notion denoted
by a whole group of words and have not the function
of any part of speech.</p>



<p><b>Peculiar Prepositions.</b>—Some words originally participles
have a use so much resembling that of prepositions
that they are no longer thought of as verbals, but have
come to be considered prepositions. Some of these are
<i>regarding</i>, <i>concerning</i>, <i>during</i>, <i>excepting</i>; as, “Our
judgments concerning the worth of things, big or little,
depend on the feelings the things arouse in us.”—<i>Wm.
James.</i></p>

<p>Some combinations of words, like <i>as to</i>, <i>out of</i>, <i>instead
of</i>, <i>according to</i>, <i>owing to</i>, are now regarded as single
prepositions. They express a single relation, and often
one word may be substituted for them; as, “You drive a
gambler out of the gambling room who loads dice.”—<i>Ruskin.</i>
“The Prince of Orange had not been consulted
as to the formation of the league.”—<i>Motley.</i></p>



<p><b>Is “Like” a Preposition?</b>—It is not uncommon to find
both verbs and nouns taking as an adjunct a phrase introduced
by <i>like</i>; for example,</p>

<p>“That hand was cold, a frozen thing,—it dropped
from his <i>like lead</i>.”—<i>Mrs. Hemans.</i></p>

<p>“Now and then he would see a thin fin, <i>like a big
shark’s fin</i>, drifting along close to shore.”—<i>Kipling.</i></p>

<p>In such a phrase there is always a substantive, and if
this is changed to a personal pronoun we find that it is
in the objective case; for example, “A writer is so like a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</span>
lover.”—<i>Holmes.</i> Substituting a pronoun for <i>lover</i> we
find that usage calls for the objective form <i>him</i>. Does
this prove that <i>like</i> is a preposition and <i>him</i> its object?</p>

<p>There is authority in dictionaries and grammars for
calling <i>like</i> a preposition, and this is certainly both simple
and convenient; but sometimes it leads us into difficulties.
In the sentence,—“He walks more like a soldier
than a priest,” shall we say that the preposition <i>like</i>
is compared? In the sentence,—“It is very like a
whale,” shall we say that the preposition <i>like</i> is modified
by the adverb <i>very</i>, a word that we expect to modify only
adjectives and adverbs? In the sentence,—“Like to an
angel of peace she seemed that day,” how shall we dispose
of <i>to</i> if we call <i>like</i> a preposition governing <i>angel</i>?</p>

<p>If we go back to the writings of Milton and Shakespeare,
we find the words <i>liker</i> and <i>likest</i>, showing plainly
that in their time <i>like</i> was looked upon as an adjective or
adverb. We often find, too, the preposition <i>to</i> or <i>unto</i>
expressed after <i>like</i>. It is best, therefore, to dispose of
<i>like</i> as an adjective, meaning <i>similar</i>, when it introduces
a phrase modifying a noun or completing a verb; and as
an adverb, when the phrase modifies a verb. It will
then be necessary to supply the preposition <i>to</i> or <i>unto</i>.</p>

<p>Words whose use much resembles that of <i>like</i> are <i>near</i>
and its comparative and superlative forms, <i>nearer</i>, <i>nearest</i>
and <i>next</i>; as, “Near the foot of the walls there are
magnificent groves of live oaks and pines.”—<i>Muir.</i></p>

<p>In this sentence we consider <i>near</i> an adverb, modified
by a phrase introduced by <i>to</i> understood. Indeed, the
preposition is very often expressed; for example, “It
was next <i>to</i> impossible for a peasant or artisan or even
a merchant to pass that line.”—<i>Lord.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</span></p>

<p>A construction similar to this is found in the sentence,
“To be the supreme authority in anything is a satisfaction
to self-love next door to the precious delusions of
dementia.”—<i>Holmes.</i> Here <i>next door</i> takes the place
of <i>next</i>. It should be treated as one adjective element
modifying <i>satisfaction</i> and itself modified by the adverbial
propositional phrase following it.</p>



<p><b>The Prepositional Phrase modified.</b>—We sometimes find
a prepositional phrase accompanied by an adverb or by a
noun used adverbially, as a sort of measure; thus, “Before
his father and mother died, they had built, some way
from their palace, a very beautiful temple.”—<i>Old Deccan
Days.</i> In this sentence the verb <i>built</i> is modified by
the phrase <i>some way from their palace</i>, the base of this
being the prepositional phrase <i>from their palace</i>; this
phrase is modified by <i>some way</i>, a noun element used
adverbially to answer the question <i>how far from their
palace?</i></p>

<p>In this sentence from John Lord,—“Why did no
great scholars arise, even in the church?” the adverb
<i>even</i> modifying the phrase <i>in the church</i> has a very important
office. Its presence in the sentence entirely
changes the meaning. Without <i>even</i>, the sentence would
tell us that no great scholars arose in one place, the
church; but with <i>even</i> the sentence tells us that no great
scholars arose anywhere, and that it was very strange
that they did not arise in the church, where we should
naturally expect to find them.</p>

<p>Two prepositional phrases joined by <i>and</i> are often
each modified by the adverb <i>partly</i>, or even by the pronoun
<i>what</i> used adverbially. <i>What</i> may also modify one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</span>
prepositional phrase; thus, “What with teaching others
and studying closely myself, I had hardly a spare moment.”</p>



<p><b>The Preposition modified.</b>—So many prepositions were
originally adverbs or may be used as adverbs, that it is
not strange to find them taking adverbial modifiers.
Hence we frequently meet such a succession of words as
<i>ever since</i>, <i>just outside</i>, <i>right over</i>; as, “A horticulturist
of eminence wanted me to sow lines of strawberries and
raspberries right over where I had put my potatoes in
drills.”—<i>Warner.</i></p>



<p><b>Position of the Preposition.</b>—The word <i>preposition</i>,
meaning <i>placed before</i>, implies that this part of speech
precedes its object, but this it not always the case. It is
not uncommon in poetry to find the phrase inverted; for
example,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Pleasant it was when woods were green,</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">And winds were soft and low,</div>
    <div class="verse indent1">To lie amid some sylvan scene,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Where, <i>the long drooping boughs between</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Shadows dark and sunlight sheen</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">Alternate come and go.”—<i>Longfellow.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>We find the transposition, too, in the familiar expressions
<i>the year round</i>, <i>the night through</i>, <i>the world over</i>;
as, “The evergreens can keep a secret the year round,
some one has said.”—<i>Burroughs.</i></p>



<p><b>The Prepositional Phrase as an Abridgment of a Proposition.</b>—In
the chapter on the adverbial clause of degree
we found that the clause as expressed frequently consists<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</span>
only of the conjunction and a prepositional phrase; as,
“The force of the wind had never been greater <i>than at
this moment</i>.” We cannot give a satisfactory analysis
of such a sentence without supplying after <i>than</i> the subject
<i>it</i> and the verb <i>was</i>. It is best also to supply where
a clause of manner has been abridged; as, “The scene
changed <i>as at a theatre</i>.”</p>

<p>But there are sentences in which propositions have been
abridged to prepositional phrases and no ellipsis can be
supplied; for example, “In manner he was quiet and
gentlemanlike, <i>with the natural courtesy of high breeding</i>.”—<i>Froude.</i>
In this sentence the phrase is equivalent
to an independent proposition joined to the first
proposition by the conjunction <i>and</i>,—“<i>and he had the
natural courtesy of high breeding</i>.” Such a phrase may
be described as an accompaniment of the predicate rather
than a modifier of any word in it.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE APPOSITIVE PHRASE</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—As a means of avoiding a predication, perhaps
no other sentence-element is oftener employed than
the appositive phrase; as, “They have the genius for
hard work—<i>the most desirable kind of genius</i>.” The
appositive is a very loosely joined adjunct, but its position
in the sentence and the frequency of its use make its relation
easily intelligible.</p>

<p>The appositive phrase comes about in this way. The
sentence quoted above really amounts to two independent
propositions; namely, They have the genius for hard
work, and, The genius for hard work is the most desirable
kind of genius. These propositions joined into a closely
built sentence with proper subordination might read thus,—They
have the genius for hard work, which is the
most desirable kind of genius. Here we have an unrestrictive
adjective clause.</p>

<p>The important part of this clause, the only part that
adds anything new to the sentence, is the complement,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</span>
<i>the most desirable kind of genius</i>. The subject <i>which</i>
merely represents a previous word, and the verb <i>is</i> is only
a link between the subject and its attribute, the complement.
These two words help in the grammatical structure
of the proposition, but since they are easily supplied
by a reader, they may just as well be omitted, as in fact
is often the case. This brings the really important words
into a position next to what they explain or describe, but
without any relation-words between them. A group of
words so used is called an appositive phrase. The base-word
of the phrase, usually a noun, is called a noun in
apposition.</p>

<p>In general the appositive is not a necessary element of
the sentence. So far as the truth of the statement and
the grammatical structure of the sentence are concerned,
it may be omitted. Sometimes, however, it is joined to a
noun to point out a special individual or class, when it resembles
the restrictive adjective clause; as, “It is quite
true that practical life is a kind of long, competitive
examination, conducted by that severe pedagogue, Professor
Circumstance.”—<i>Huxley.</i></p>



<p><b>The Base-Word of an Appositive Phrase.</b>—When
the base-word of an appositive phrase is a noun, it gives
another name for something, and so makes that thing
more fully known by revealing another of its attributes;
as, “We turn to commemorate the genius and virtues of
John Milton, the poet, the statesman, the philosopher, the
glory of English literature, the champion and the martyr
of English liberty.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p>Attributes are just as often told by adjectives as by
nouns, hence we find many appositive adjectives; as,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</span></p>

<p>“At the first glimpse he thought it a dog—<i>long, lean,
skulking, prowling, tawny</i>—on the scent of his tracks.”—<i>J.
L. Allen.</i> The adjectives are an abridgment of an
unrestrictive adjective clause, just as appositive nouns are.</p>

<p>Besides the noun and the adjective, the base-word of an
appositive phrase may be,—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) A reflexive pronoun; as, “The old Professor <i>himself</i>
sometimes visited the house after it had changed
hands.”—<i>Holmes.</i> This pronoun does not explain or
describe in the least. It is put into the sentence for emphasis.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) A personal pronoun. This forms a convenient
word to add a phrase or clause to; as,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“How good it was of him</div>
    <div class="verse indent8">To mind a slender man like me,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>He of the mighty limb</i>.”—<i>Holmes.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>(<i>c</i>) A pronominal adjective. This does not explain.
It has not sufficient meaning in itself for that. Like the
personal pronoun it is to be modified by some phrase or
other sentence-element that has meaning; as, “On a
gently rising ground in the heart of the city rises St.
Paul’s, <i>one</i> of the largest churches in the world, and a
masterpiece of Wren, <i>one</i> of the greatest architects.” In
neither place here does <i>one</i> mean anything until it is
modified by the phrase telling class.</p>

<p>Such an appositive may serve many purposes. In the
following sentence from Lowell, “The poetry of the
Danes was <i>much of it</i> authentic history,” it narrows the
scope of what it modifies,—<i>the poetry of the Danes</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The infinitive. See Chapter XX.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) The gerund. See Chapter XXII.</p>

<p>(<i>f</i>) The participle. When a participial phrase is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</span>
clearly an abridgment of an unrestrictive adjective clause,
it may be said to be in apposition; as,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“All are architects of Fate,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0"><i>Working in these walls of Time</i>.”—<i>Longfellow.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>(<i>g</i>) The noun clause. See Chapter VII.</p>



<p><b>Words that take an Appositive Modifier.</b>—The appositive
is usually added to a noun, but not always. A
pronoun may be made definite in its application by an appositive;
thus, “<i>We</i> are doing the English cathedral
towns, <i>Aunt Celia and I</i>.”—<i>Mrs. Wiggin.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—In the following sentence from Wordsworth,—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“But oh, ye fountains, meadows, hills, and groves,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Forebode not any severing of our loves,”</div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>many would consider the nouns in the first line as appositives of <i>ye</i>.
It seems better to consider <i>ye</i> as filling the office of a limiting adjective.
If we spoke <i>about</i> the fountains, we would say <i>these fountains</i>;
speaking <i>to</i> them it is usage to employ the pronoun <i>ye</i> in the
place of <i>these</i>.</p>
</div>

<p>Occasionally we find an adjective, adverb, phrase, or
clause, explained by some sort of appositive; as, “Active
and sprightly people are called <i>mercurial</i>, that is, <i>born
under the planet Mercury</i>.” Here a participial phrase
is in apposition with the adjective <i>mercurial</i>.</p>

<p>The appositive may even be used to explain a predicate,
a use in which it very much resembles one use of the
adjective clause; as, “The surplus beyond what was required
for the support of the national worship was distributed
in alms among the poor; <i>a duty strenuously prescribed
by their moral code</i>.”—<i>Prescott.</i></p>



<p><b>Introductory Word.</b>—The appositive is frequently introduced
or brought into the sentence by such words or<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</span>
expressions as <i>namely</i>, <i>to wit</i>, <i>as</i>, <i>that is</i>, <i>or, in other
words</i>; as, “The whale is a mammal, <i>that is</i>, a warm-blooded,
air-breathing animal that suckles its young.”</p>

<p>The introductory <i>as</i> is useful in limiting the application
of a noun, signifying that it is to be considered only
to the extent denoted by the appositive; as, “To the
Esquimaux, the auk, <i>as an article of food</i>, is second in
importance only to the seal.”</p>

<p>With this restrictive office <i>as</i> often introduces an appositive
to a possessive pronoun; as, “As <i>masters your</i>
first object must be to increase your power.”—<i>Ruskin.</i>
It will readily be seen that <i>masters</i> is an appositive of
<i>your</i> if the sentence is changed thus, “The first object
of you, as masters, must be, etc.”</p>

<p><i>Such as</i> or <i>as</i> often brings in the names of several individuals
belonging to a certain class; thus, “The leaves
and tender twigs are an agreeable food to many domestic
animals, <i>as</i> the cow, horse, sheep, and goat.”—<i>Thoreau.</i></p>

<p>A noun whose meaning is broad may have two appositives,
specific in meaning, joined by <i>or</i> and introduced by
<i>whether</i>; as, “There is always something to see about a
church, <i>whether living worshipers or dead men’s tombs</i>.”—<i>Stevenson.</i></p>



<p><b>Case and Number of the Noun in Apposition.</b>—The
appositive noun is usually in the same case as the noun it
explains, but often when it is joined to a possessive noun,
the possessive case ending is dropped from the first noun
for the sake of euphony, and added only to the appositive.</p>

<p>In number an appositive usually agrees with its noun,
but not always; for example, “The <i>priests</i> were <i>each</i> devoted
to the service of some particular deity.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</span></p>



<p><b>Position of the Appositive Phrase.</b>—Usually the appositive
follows immediately the group of words it explains;
but sometimes the two are separated by intervening
words; thus, “<i>These votive pictures</i> are no less
interesting <i>as works of art</i> than as expressions of hopeless
superstition.”—<i>Howells.</i></p>

<p>Sometimes the appositive begins a sentence; as,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“<i>One burnished sheet of living gold</i>,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled.”—<i>Scott.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>“<i>Calm, strong, and nobly aglow with love of country</i>,
he has no need of going into paroxysms in order to prove
his sincerity.”—<i>Boyesen.</i></p>

<p class="c sp">THE DIRECT OBJECT</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">The</span> direct object of a transitive verb is so familiar a
sentence-element that it makes itself understood without
much special investigation. It presents few peculiarities,
and these are not difficult.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</span></p>

<p>The transitive verb is usually defined as one that
denotes action terminating on an object. This definition
does not cover all verbs called transitive, for instance,
the verb <i>have</i>, meaning <i>own</i>, which does not denote any
action whatever. But it would be difficult indeed to
make a better definition. The definition, a transitive
verb is one that takes an object, is open to the objection
that it applies only to transitive verbs in the active voice,
whereas passive verbs are also transitive in meaning.
We may say this much, however,—(<i>a</i>) no verb is considered
transitive unless it has two substantives, a subject
and a complement, the two meaning different things, an
agent and a non-agent. (<i>b</i>) A sentence containing a
transitive verb can always be changed to the passive form,
the complement becoming the subject, and the subject
of the active verb becoming the object of the preposition
<i>by</i>. This second point is a better test of the transitive
verb than the definition is.</p>

<p>For example, take the verb <i>earn</i> in the sentence,—“Indeed,
a man may earn twenty thousand dollars a year
by writing ‘sensation-stories,’ and have nothing to do
with literature in any high sense.”—<i>Higginson.</i> It is
true that when a man earns he acts, but his action is not
performed upon the twenty thousand dollars. In so far
this verb does not come under the definition of a transitive
verb; but it answers the test, that is, it may be changed
to the passive; thus, “Twenty thousand dollars was earned
by him.” This does not mean that the twenty thousand
dollars received an action; it means that twenty thousand
became his possession as a result of his work.</p>

<p>Of transitive verbs denoting action performed directly
upon some object, examples are in the following sentences.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “Let us <i>build</i> altars to the Beautiful Necessity,
which secures that all is made of one piece.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “When Gabriel <i>blows</i> his trumpet I hope he will
select the moment before sunrise for his summons.”—<i>Bolles.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “Many men <i>eat</i> finer cookery, <i>drink</i> dearer
liquors, with what advantage they can report and their
doctors can.”—<i>Carlyle.</i></p>

<p>Examples of transitive verbs like <i>earn</i> that take an
object and denote action, but not action really performed
upon the object, are found in the following sentences.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) These deluded people <i>visit</i> fortune tellers in the
hope of <i>finding out</i> what is to happen in the future.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “He <i>entered</i> the street at the end opposite to the
Holborn entrance.”—<i>George Eliot.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “As he approached the village, he <i>met</i> a number of
people.”—<i>Irving.</i></p>

<p>Action always suggests to us at first thought physical
action, that accompanied by movement; but there are
other kinds of action which may be told by transitive
verbs.</p>

<p>1. Action of the mind, denoted by such verbs as <i>believe</i>,
<i>learn</i>, <i>think</i>, <i>remember</i>; as, “<i>To know</i> anything that
turns up is, in the infinity of knowledge, <i>to know</i>
nothing.”—<i>F. Harrison.</i></p>

<p>2. Action of the emotions, denoted by such verbs as
<i>hate</i>, <i>love</i>, <i>revere</i>; as, “When Père Antoine was a very
young man, he had a friend whom he <i>loved</i> as he <i>loved</i>
his life.”</p>

<p>3. Action of the senses, denoted by the verbs <i>see</i>, <i>hear</i>,
<i>feel</i>, <i>smell</i>, <i>taste</i>; as, “<i>To see</i> a good man and <i>hear</i> his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</span>
voice once a week would be reason enough for building
churches and pulpits.”—<i>Holmes.</i></p>

<p>Verbs of saying, like <i>tell</i>, <i>remark</i>, <i>declare</i>, <i>exclaim</i>, are
followed by a direct object, usually a quotation or a noun
clause telling just what was said; thus, “He <i>cried</i> in the
bitterness of his soul that God had hid his face from him.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p>The verbs <i>ask</i> and <i>teach</i> are often followed by two
direct objects, one of the person and the other of the
thing; as, “Whoever will teach the people of New England
the advantages of good food, fresh air, and sunshine,
will renew the physical constitution of the race.”—<i>J. F.
Clarke.</i> “Ask a great money-maker what he means to
do with his money—he never knows.”—<i>Ruskin.</i></p>

<p>These verbs are really used in a double sense. For instance,
in the first sentence, in so far as <i>will teach</i> takes
the object <i>the people of New England</i>, it means <i>instruct</i>;
in so far as it takes the object <i>the advantages of good
food, fresh air and sunshine</i>, it means <i>impart</i>. When
such a sentence is changed to the passive form, either object
may become the subject, and the other may remain
as the object of the passive verb; or, if the personal object
remains, it may be called an indirect object.</p>

<p>Some verbs usually intransitive may become transitive
by being followed by a cognate object, that is, one whose
meaning is akin to that of the verb, as in the familiar
expressions <i>run a race</i>, <i>dream a dream</i>, <i>smile a smile</i>;
as, “There he fell into evil paths, and on a fatal day
<i>sinned a great sin</i>.”—<i>Hillis.</i></p>

<p>Some transitive verbs may be followed by an object
meaning the same person or thing as the subject. This
is called a reflexive object; as, “On the wall opposite,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</span>
about a mile across the gulf, <i>a brook was pouring itself</i>
to the valley.”—<i>King.</i> In this sentence the brook is
conceived in two aspects, that of a doer and that of a
receiver—it pours and is poured.</p>

<p>Some verbs are made transitive by the addition of an
adverb; as,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Ring out the old, ring in the new,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Ring out the false, ring in the true.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent10">—<i>Tennyson.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>Here <i>the old</i> is the object not of the verb <i>ring</i>, but of
the verb <i>ring out</i>.</p>

<p>Frequently a preposition is to be taken with a verb,
the two words denoting one idea and that transitive; as,
“You cannot stir abroad but Jews and Christians <i>pounce
upon</i> you with unsettled bonds.”—<i>Carlyle.</i> A test for
this sort of compound verb is that when it is changed to
the passive form, the two words—verb and preposition—remain
together; thus, “You are pounced upon by
Jews and Christians.”</p>

<p>In the sentence, “Make up your mind to forego driving
sledge,” we have four different direct objects. (1) The
compound verb <i>make up</i> takes the object <i>your mind</i>.
(2) The whole group of words <i>make up your mind</i> is
equivalent to the one verb <i>decide</i>, and as such takes the
infinitive phrase for object, <i>to forego driving sledge</i>.
(3) The object of the infinitive <i>to forego</i> is the gerund-phrase
<i>driving sledge</i>. (4) The object of the gerund
<i>driving</i> is the noun <i>sledge</i>.</p>

<p>A combination of two verbs with the meaning of one
transitive verb is found in the every-day expression <i>make
believe</i>, meaning <i>pretend</i>. This cannot be separated. It
is usually followed by an infinitive or a noun clause used<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</span>
as its object. For example, “Whereupon the puppy
jumped into the air off all its feet at once, with a yelp
of delight, and rushed at the stick and made believe to
worry it.”—<i>Lewis Carroll.</i></p>

<p class="c sp">THE SUBJECTIVE COMPLEMENT</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—When we wish to assert that a thing possesses
a certain quality, we do it by a predicate made up
of some form of the verb <i>be</i> together with an adjective;
as in the sentence, “The very name was uncanny.”—<i>Page.</i>
Here the idea words are the subject noun and the
adjective in the predicate; the verb <i>was</i> serves merely as a
copula, or tie-word, necessary for the grammatical structure
of the sentence, but having little, if any, meaning.</p>

<p>The verb is employed in the same way when we wish
to denote—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The identity of two ideas; as, “The secret of
success is concentration.”—<i>Schreiner.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The class to which a thing belongs; as, “Ben
Battle was a soldier bold.”—<i>Hood.</i></p>

<p>In such sentences as the three quoted, we call the adjective
or noun in the predicate a <i>subjective complement</i>
of the verb. The noun is often termed a predicate
nominative, and the adjective a predicate adjective. In
either case the complement tells some attribute of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</span>
subject, and it is for the express purpose of telling this
attribute that such sentences are made. These sentences
are very common, being framed to answer certain questions
that it is natural for the mind to ask; namely, who
is he? what is it? what kind of person is he? what sort
of thing is it?</p>

<p>The noun used as base-word of a subjective complement
does not necessarily agree with the subject in
number; as, “Justice and Reverence are the everlasting
central Law of the Universe.”—<i>Carlyle.</i></p>

<p>Neither does the subjective complement have to succeed
its verb. Sometimes the whole order of the sentence is
inverted; thus, “Fair as a summer dream was Margaret.”—<i>Lowell.</i>
“A very attractive person is that child-loving
girl.”—<i>Miss Mitford.</i></p>



<p><b>The Subjective Complement not always a Noun or Adjective.</b>—Often,
as was stated in Chapter XXIII, a prepositional
phrase takes the place of a predicate adjective,
usually because we have no adjective adequate to express
the meaning of the phrase. In this sentence from Lowell,—“Popular
literature is <i>of value</i>,” the adjective <i>valuable</i>
might well be substituted for the phrase; but in the following
sentences the language affords no equivalent adjectives.—“I
am <i>in love</i> with this green earth.”—<i>Lamb.</i>
“J. G. Whittier is <i>of a Quaker family</i> and was
born in Haverhill, Massachusetts.”</p>

<p>The noun clause, the root infinitive, the gerund, and
the participle used as subjective complements, have been
discussed in preceding chapters.</p>

<p>To this use must also be referred the personal pronoun
in the possessive case used as in the sentence,—“All<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</span>
the beauty of these summer days is <i>mine</i>.” Is this pronoun
a predicate nominative meaning <i>my beauty</i>, or is
it a predicate adjective meaning <i>possessed by me</i>, or
shall we make no attempt to classify it at all?</p>

<p>The word <i>so</i> often does duty as a subjective complement.
It is used to avoid a repetition of some noun or
adjective; as, “The house is empty and has been <i>so</i> for
months.”</p>



<p><b>Verbs that take a Subjective Complement.</b>—The
verb <i>be</i> is by no means the only one that may be completed
by a subjective complement. There are numerous others,
most of which will fall in the following classes.</p>

<p>1. <i>Become</i>, and verbs of similar meaning, like <i>grow</i>,
<i>get</i>, <i>turn</i>; as, “Bob had grown up very handsome.”—<i>Page.</i></p>

<p>2. Certain verbs of position like <i>stand</i>, <i>sit</i>, <i>lie</i>; as,
“The moon stood bright and full in the heavens.”—<i>Howells.</i></p>

<p>3. Verbs signifying to appear to the senses, like <i>look</i>,
<i>feel</i>, <i>smell</i>, <i>sound</i>, <i>taste</i>; as, “Our own thought sounds
new and larger from his mouth.”—<i>Emerson.</i> “Both
he and his wife looked outwardly gentlefolks.”—<i>Lamb.</i></p>

<p>4. A few verbs denoting action, like <i>begin</i>, <i>come</i>, <i>go</i>,
<i>rise</i>, <i>spring</i>; as, “One that goes in a nurse may come
out an angel.”—<i>Holmes.</i> With this class of verbs an
adjective complement often seems to partake of the nature
of an adverb; as, “They descended <i>fearless</i> into all gulfs
and bedlams.”—<i>Carlyle.</i> The author must decide
whether to use the adjective or the adverb by his purpose.
That is, does he wish to make more prominent the condition
of the subject or the manner of the action?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</span></p>

<p>5. Certain passive verbs. In general these are:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Verbs of <i>calling</i>; as, “The place is fitly called
Inspiration Point.”—<i>King.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Verbs of <i>deeming</i>; as, “I have been counted a
successful teacher.”—<i>Annie Preston.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Verbs of <i>making</i>; as, “The forlorn condition of
the new settlers was made still worse by domestic feuds.”—<i>Prescott.</i></p>



<p><b>Introductory Word.</b>—After some verbs it is usage to
precede the complement by <i>as</i> or <i>for</i>, sometimes even by
the infinitive <i>to be</i>. These words are not connectives,
nor do they add anything to the meaning of the sentence,
though often they do serve to make it more clear; thus,
“Chaucer undoubtedly began as an imitator, perhaps as
mere translator.”—<i>Lowell.</i></p>

<p>If <i>as</i> were omitted, it might not be clear at once that
<i>imitator</i> is not a direct object of <i>began</i>.</p>

<p class="c sp">THE OBJECTIVE COMPLEMENT</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—Sometimes an action performed upon an
object makes a different thing of that object. Our desire
to tell this as briefly as possible has given rise to sentences
in which a transitive verb is followed by two complements,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</span>
one a direct object naming the thing acted upon,
and the other an attribute of the direct object telling the
outcome of the activity denoted by the verb; as, “By his
Sketch Book Irving has made the Hudson a classic river.”</p>

<p>The second complement is quite as often an adjective
as a noun; for example,</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“Shafts of sunshine from the west</div>
    <div class="verse indent22">Paint the dusky windows red.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent23">—<i>Longfellow.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>We understand from this sentence that the windows
undergo the action denoted by the words <i>paint red</i>, and
are therefore changed from dusky windows to red windows.</p>

<p>Such a word as <i>river</i> in the first sentence or <i>red</i> in
the second is called an objective complement. A noun
used in this office somewhat resembles an appositive,
being a second name for an object already named; but the
appositive has no relation to any word except the noun
it explains, while the objective complement has a very
important relation to the predicate verb. So close is this
relation that we may often express the meaning of the
two words, the verb and the objective complement, by
one word; as, “Political freedom makes every man an
individual.”—<i>Higginson.</i> Here the verb <i>makes</i> and
the objective complement <i>an individual</i> may be combined
into the one verb <i>individualizes</i>.</p>

<p>The close complementary relation of the objective
complement to the predicate verb is still further brought
out when a sentence of this type is changed to the passive
form. There arises the sentence discussed in section 5
in the preceding chapter, a sentence wherein the direct
object of the active verb has become the subject of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</span>
passive verb, and the objective complement still remains
after the verb but becomes a subjective complement.</p>



<p><b>Verbs that take an Objective Complement</b>:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Verbs of <i>making</i>, such as <i>render</i>, <i>elect</i>, <i>appoint</i>,
called factitive verbs; as, “Old habits of work, old habits
of hope, made my endless leisure irksome to me.”</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Verbs of <i>thinking</i>, such as <i>consider</i>, <i>regard</i>, <i>look
upon</i>; as, “The student is to read history actively and
not passively, to esteem his own life the text, and books
the commentary.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Verbs of <i>naming</i> or <i>calling</i>; as, “We do not hesitate
to pronounce them a brave, a wise, an honest, and a
useful body.”—<i>Macaulay.</i></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) The verbs <i>feel</i>, <i>find</i>, <i>leave</i>, <i>prove</i>, <i>see</i>; as, “He
had never seen her so radiant, so young.”—<i>J. L. Allen.</i>
“Chaucer, like Dante, found his native tongue a dialect
and left it a language.”—<i>Lowell.</i></p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) Some intransitive verbs are completed in this
way, especially when the direct object is a reflexive
personal pronoun; as, “They shouted themselves hoarse.”
“She cried herself sick.” These sentences mean—“They
made themselves hoarse by shouting”; “she made
herself sick by crying.”</p>



<p><b>Introductory Word.</b>—After some verbs usage puts in
the word <i>as</i> or <i>for</i> before the objective complement,
using it merely as an introductory word; thus, “I respected
him as a sound and accurate scholar.”—<i>De
Quincey.</i></p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“No harmless thing that breathed,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Footed or winged, but knew him for a friend.”</div>
    <div class="verse indent12">—<i>Aldrich.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</span></p>

<p>When these sentences are changed to the passive, the
introductory word is usually retained before the subjective
complement.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Note.</span>—After <i>as</i> the participle may take the place of an adjective;
as, “I consider him as having lost his right.” The participle has
here the same use that the adjective <i>destitute</i> has in the expression
<i>destitute of his right</i>.</p>
</div>



<p><b>Position of the Objective Complement.</b>—It usually
follows the direct object, but the adjective so used is
sometimes placed next to the verb, and the noun may, to
render it emphatic, be placed at the beginning of the
sentence; as, “Grape shot will sweep clear all streets.”—<i>Carlyle.</i>
“A perpetual fountain of good sense Dryden
calls Chaucer.”—<i>Lowell.</i></p>

<p>We have certain stereotyped verb-phrases such as <i>make
free</i>, <i>think best</i>, and <i>see fit</i>, in which the adjective is so
closely related to the verb that it is placed next to it, and
the two words have acquired the meaning of one verb.
<i>Make free</i> has almost the meaning of <i>dare</i>; for the other
two phrases there are no good substitutes. These phrases
are followed by an infinitive phrase used as direct object.
For example,—“A native of that region saw fit to build
his house very near it.”—<i>Holmes.</i></p>

</div>

<p class="c sp">THE INDIRECT OBJECT</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—Many verbs are followed by two substantives,
both of which are called objects; for example,
“Abbot Samson read his monks a severe lecture.”—<i>Carlyle.</i>
“I will tell you a common case.”—<i>De
Quincey.</i> “For this did God send her a great reward.”—<i>De
Quincey.</i> If we ask the questions <i>read what?</i> <i>will
tell what?</i> <i>did send what?</i> the answers are the direct
objects of the verbs, namely, <i>a severe lecture</i>, <i>a common
case</i>, <i>a great reward</i>.</p>

<p>If we go farther and ask the questions, read a severe
lecture <i>to whom?</i> will tell a common case <i>to whom?</i> did
send a great reward <i>to whom?</i> the answers are—<i>to his
monks</i>, <i>to you</i>, <i>to her</i>. But in the sentences as quoted
the preposition to is not expressed, the meaning being
evident without it. A word used like <i>monks</i>, <i>you</i>, <i>her</i>,
is called the indirect object of the verb. It is not a
complement, for the meaning of the verb is complete
without it; but it is brought into the sentence by the
verb, and is therefore its adjunct.</p>

<p>The indirect object is usually defined as denoting the
one to whom or for whom something is done. It is not
always, however, a personal word, as is seen in Shakespeare’s
sentence,—“Give <i>thy thoughts</i> no tongue nor
<i>any unproportioned thought</i> his act.”</p>



<p><b>Position of the Indirect Object.</b>—The position of the
indirect object is next to the verb. If its position is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</span>
changed, the preposition is expressed, as is seen in the
sentences,—“Mother made <i>me</i> a dress,” and “Mother
made a dress <i>for me</i>.” The logical use of the word <i>me</i>
is identical in the two sentences, but the sentences are
built differently. It prevents confusion if we call <i>me</i> in
the second sentence the object of the preposition <i>for</i>,
the phrase <i>for me</i> being an adjunct of the verb just as the
one word <i>me</i> is an adjunct of the verb in the first sentence.</p>



<p><b>The Indirect Object in a Passive Sentence.</b>—When
sentences containing direct and indirect objects are
changed to the passive form, the direct object should
become the subject, and the indirect object should remain
after the verb or should become the object of an
expressed preposition. If we change the sentence, “Abbot
Samson read his monks a severe lecture,” we should
have, “A severe lecture was read to his monks by Abbot
Samson.” But it is a common practice to make the indirect
object the subject of the passive verb and leave the
direct object unchanged; thus, “The monks were read
a severe lecture by Abbot Samson.” In this sentence
<i>lecture</i> is called a residual object of the passive verb
<i>were read</i>.</p>

<p>Sentences arising in this way are often extremely
awkward, and should not be tolerated; for example, “I
was sold a horse.”</p>



<p><b>Verbs that take an Indirect Object.</b>—The most common
are bring, build, cost, cut, do, fling, forgive, get,
give, grant, hand, leave, make, offer, pay, play, pledge,
promise, reach, read, sell, send, show, teach, tell, throw,
weigh, win, wish, yield.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</span></p>

<p>Since the indirect object is not a necessary sentence-element,
it follows that it is frequently omitted, so that
we find these verbs taking only the direct object. On the
other hand, we occasionally find verbs followed by an
indirect object and no direct object. This comes about
in several ways.—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) When the sentence is changed to the passive form
and the preposition <i>to</i> or <i>for</i> is not supplied; as, “This
chance was never offered <i>me</i> before.”—<i>James Thomson.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) When the direct object is omitted, being unimportant

<p class="c sp">THE ADVERBIAL NOUN</p>


<p><b>Function.</b>—Questions like <i>how long?</i> <i>how far?</i> <i>when?</i>
<i>where?</i> are often answered by adverbs, phrases, or
clauses; but they may be answered by nouns, as in the
following sentences,—“<i>A while</i> she paused; no answer
came.”—<i>Scott.</i> “We are transported <i>a hundred and
fifty years</i> back.”—<i>Macaulay.</i> “<i>Every moment</i> they
came nearer. <i>Next door</i> lives a carpenter.”—<i>Miss
Mitford.</i></p>

<p>It is clear that the italicized expressions are used adverbially,
modifying respectively the verb <i>paused</i>, the adverb
<i>back</i>, the verb <i>came</i>, and the verb <i>lives</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</span></p>

<p>The base-word of each of these expressions is a noun,
called an adverbial noun. It is immaterial to us what
case this noun is in, but a study of Old English teaches us
that it is in the objective case, while a further proof is
that we frequently employ a preposition before it.</p>

<p>The adverbial noun usually denotes measure of some
sort, of time, distance, space, weight, value, etc.</p>



<p><b>What the Adverbial Noun modifies.</b>—1. A verb; as,
“A man could have found places where he could have
jumped three thousand feet in one descent to the valley.”—<i>King.</i></p>

<p>2. An adjective; as, “He was nearly a head taller than
myself.”</p>

<p>The adjective <i>worth</i> is always modified by an adverbial
noun answering the question <i>how much?</i> and frequently
by others answering various other questions; as,
“Wheat worth a dollar a bushel last week is selling now
for eighty cents.” Notice that the modifiers of <i>worth</i>
differ in closeness of relation; the closest is <i>dollar</i>, the
next <i>bushel</i>, and the next <i>week</i>. This is not determined
by position.</p>

<p>3. An adverb; as, “The oldest sergeant present stepped
a pace forward.”</p>

<p>4. A phrase; as, “Centuries before this the Chinese
had printed books by means of carved wooden blocks.”</p>

<p>5. A clause; as, “His room is hung round with cases
of them, each impaled on a pin driven through him
something as they used to bury suicides.”—<i>Holmes.</i></p>

<p>In such a sentence as, “He is forty years of age,” it
is somewhat difficult to determine whether <i>years</i> modifies
<i>of age</i> or <i>of age</i> modifies <i>years</i>. This arises perhaps<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</span>
from the fact that neither <i>years</i> nor <i>of age</i> makes a good
base for the complement of <i>is</i>. He is not forty years,
neither does the sentence mean that he is of age. We
must say that <i>is</i> is completed by the expression <i>forty
years of age</i>, used adjectively and having the meaning
of one word. If we wish to go further and analyze this
complement, we say that <i>of age</i> is the base, meaning <i>old</i>,
and that this phrase is modified by the adverbial noun
<i>forty years</i>.</p>

<p>It is the same in the sentence, “We often read about
precipices that are thousands of feet in descent.”—<i>King.</i>
The verb <i>are</i> is completed by the group of words, <i>thousands
of feet in descent</i>, having the meaning of <i>very
high</i>. Of this group <i>in descent</i> is the base modified
by the adverbial noun <i>thousands of feet</i>.</p>

<p>A common construction is found in the sentence,
“About two weeks ago I looked down from the Mariposa
trail into the tremendous fissure of the Sierras.” In
analyzing the adverbial element <i>about two weeks ago</i>, we
find the base-word to be the adverb <i>ago</i>; this is modified
by the adverbial noun <i>about two weeks</i>, the base of
which is <i>weeks</i> modified first by <i>two</i> and then by <i>about</i>.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><span class="smcap">Notes.</span>—1. Many prefer to consider <i>about</i> a preposition, governing
<i>weeks</i>, and <i>ago</i> an adjective modifying <i>weeks</i>. But in the
familiar expression <i>long ago</i>, <i>ago</i> is said to be an adverb, and its use
seems to us the same in the expression <i>two weeks ago</i>. It is a case
where use rather than derivation should determine the part of
speech. <i>About</i> has the same relation to <i>two weeks</i> that <i>almost</i>
would have in the same position.</p>

<p>2. A further expression denoting degree, which may well be
noticed here, is found in the sentences,—“John is good and strong”;
“She sailed good and fast.” In the first sentence it is not the
author’s intention to give two attributes of John; the sentence
means that John is very strong. In analyzing the sentence it is best<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</span>
not to separate the group of words <i>good and strong</i>. In the following
sentence from Stevenson,—“But I was rare and hungry,” the
substitution of <i>rare</i> for <i>good</i> makes the sentence mean,—“I was unusually
hungry.”</p>

</div>

<p class="c sp">PECULIAR MODIFICATIONS</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">It</span> is not uncommon to find words modified in what
seems to us an ungrammatical way; for example, an
article modifying an adjective, as in the phrase <i>all the
same</i>, or an adverb modifying a noun, as in the sentence,
“We walked the whole distance, <i>exactly three miles</i>,”
where the adverb <i>exactly</i> is a modifier of the noun phrase
<i>three miles</i>. Some of these modifications we shall now
consider.</p>

<p>1. The article <i>the</i> modifying an adjective.—We find
this in many phrases that have become current in literature
no less than in conversation; for example, <i>all the
quicker</i>, <i>none the worse</i>, <i>quite the contrary</i>, <i>at the best</i>.
In some instances, as in the last example given, we may
say that the adjective has become a substantive in meaning
and hence may be modified by the article. In other
cases a noun may be supplied after the adjective, and the
article may be said to modify the noun. But in most
cases the adjective is used in the sense of an adjective,
and it is impossible, too, to supply any noun after it, so
we must take the expression as we find it and say that the
article modifies an adjective, the construction being idiomatical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</span></p>

<p>Illustrations of this construction are found in the following
sentences:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of seals
watched them being driven, but they went on playing
<i>just the same</i>.”—<i>Kipling.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “The negroes declared that under the old house
were solid rock chambers which had been built for dungeons,
and had served for purposes which were <i>none
the less</i> awful because they were vague and indefinite.”</p>

<p>Many of these phrases contain a modifying adverb. In
<i>just the same</i>, the adverb <i>just</i> modifies <i>the same</i>. In
<i>all the more</i> we have <i>all</i> used adverbially to modify <i>the
more</i>.</p>

<p>The base-word of these phrases is just as often an adverb
as an adjective, as in the sentences, “This news only
made us walk <i>the faster</i>”; “He did it <i>none the worse</i> for
the many interruptions.”</p>

<p>2. In such expressions as <i>a few books</i>, <i>a good many
trees</i>, the article <i>a</i> may seem at first thought to modify
a plural noun; but this is not the case. The article
modifies the pronominal adjectives <i>few</i> and <i>many</i>, having
the meaning of collective nouns, that is, meaning individuals
taken as a group instead of singly. This pronominal
is then modified by the prepositional phrase <i>of
books</i>, <i>of trees</i>, with the preposition <i>of</i> understood.
Usage alone settles for us when the preposition is to be
expressed. We say <i>a few of them</i>; but if we use a noun
in place of the pronoun <i>them</i> we omit the preposition;
as, <i>a few pennies</i>. We say <i>a score of years</i>, and <i>a couple
of years</i>, but we omit the preposition after <i>dozen</i>, another
word denoting number, and say <i>a dozen years</i>. After
the collective noun <i>crowd</i> we express the preposition; as,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</span>
<i>a crowd of boys</i>; but if we say <i>a great many</i> in place
of <i>crowd</i>, we omit the preposition, saying <i>a great many
boys</i>. For analysis, however, the preposition should
always be supplied.</p>

<p>3. Adverbs sometimes modify nouns.—This comes
about often by abridging an adjective clause to an appositive
phrase; for example, “John Adams was born at
Quincy, <i>then part</i> of the ancient town of Braintree, on
the 19th day of October (O. S.) 1735.”—<i>Webster.</i> If
we supply <i>which was</i> after the noun <i>Quincy</i>, we have an
adjective clause, in which the adverb <i>then</i> modifies the
whole predicate—a regular construction. But in the
sentence as originally written, the adverb modifies the
noun <i>part</i>.</p>

<p>We occasionally find nouns used in the place of these
modifying adverbs. We may say <i>thrice the amount</i>,
wherein <i>amount</i> is modified by the adverb <i>thrice</i>, or we
may substitute for <i>thrice</i> the noun phrase <i>three times</i>.
We also find the noun <i>something</i> used in the place of the
adverb <i>somewhat</i>, as in the sentence,—“He had something
the manner of a Southerner.” Such a word restricts
the application of the noun it modifies. The adverbs
<i>almost</i> and <i>about</i> are used in the same way, as in
<i>almost a year</i>, <i>about a pound</i>.</p>

<p><i>But</i> is frequently used adjectively in the sense of <i>only</i>,
having a limiting or restrictive force; thus, “He was but
one generation removed from the soil.”—<i>Boyesen.</i></p>

<p>Examples of adverbs modifying nouns are found in the
following sentences:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “The Scheld, <i>almost exclusively a Belgian river</i>,
after leaving its fountains in Picardy, flows through the
pleasant provinces of Flanders and Hainault.”—<i>Motley.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “It may well be doubted whether Roman literature,
<i>always a half-hardy exotic</i>, could ripen the seeds of living
reproduction.”—<i>Lowell.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “South Dome is a vast globe of bold rock, <i>almost
a full mile</i> in height.”—<i>King.</i></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) “I fell a helpless prey to a boatman who addressed
me in some words of wonderful English and then rowed
me to the sea wall at about <i>thrice the usual fare</i>.”—<i>Howells.</i></p>

<p>4. Some nouns like <i>howl</i>, <i>cry</i>, <i>shock</i>, derived from
verbs denoting action, may be modified by an adverbial
clause of time or place. We may say, “He cried out joyfully
when he caught sight of me,” where the clause
modifies the predicate <i>cried out joyfully</i>; or we may say,
“His cry when he caught sight of me was joyful,” where
the same clause with the same meaning modifies the subject
<i>his cry</i>.</p>

<p>A clause introduced by <i>as</i>, with the meaning and construction
of an adverbial clause of manner, may modify
a noun and so save several words; for example, “Their
plays are much shorter than the standard drama <i>as it is
known to us</i>.”—<i>Howells.</i> Here <i>as</i> is equivalent to the
group of words <i>in the form in which</i>.</p>

<p>5. There are some modifiers of verbs consisting of
several words which should not be separated, inasmuch
as they express only one idea. Some of these are <i>by and
by</i>, <i>off hand</i>, <i>day by day</i>, <i>side by side</i>. Some of these
expressions after they have been considered as units may
be separated into their compound elements. In the sentence,
“They have infested the place time out of mind,”
we say that the predicate <i>have infested the place</i> is modified
by the adverbial phrase <i>time out of mind</i>, this having<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</span>
the force of one adverb. We may then say that this
phrase is made up of the noun <i>time</i> modified by the prepositional
phrase <i>out of mind</i>.</p>

<p>6. Certain absolute phrases have become equivalent to
single words and as such are used adjectively or adverbially
to modify nouns or verbs. Some of these are
<i>wrong side out</i>, <i>upside down</i>, <i>one behind the other</i>. Each
of these consists of a substantive—<i>wrong side</i>, <i>upside</i>,
<i>one</i>,—and an attribute of this substantive—<i>out</i>, <i>down</i>,
and <i>behind the other</i>. These attributes are joined directly
to the substantive because of the omission of the participle
<i>being</i>. Examples of these phrases are found in the following
sentences:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “Apoplexy is only egotism <i>wrong side out</i>.”—<i>Holmes.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “Salvationists sat <i>three in a seat</i> and played concertinas.”—<i>Bolles.</i></p>

<p>2. We also have the noun used independently by pleonasm,
that is, either for emphasis or to call the reader’s
attention to the subject that is to be talked about; as,
“<i>The birds that come about one’s door in winter or that
build in his trees in summer</i>, what a peculiar interest they
have.”—<i>Burroughs.</i> The base of this independent element
is the noun <i>birds</i>; the element is long because of the
two restrictive adjective clauses modifying <i>birds</i>.</p>

<p>Often this independent noun is introduced by <i>as for</i> or
<i>as to</i>; <i>thus</i>, “<i>As for the boy</i>, he turned up after a while as
a constant guest.”—<i>Howells.</i> The words <i>as for</i> indicate
that the boy had already been the subject of discourse
in some previous sentence.</p>

<p>3. The words <i>well</i>, <i>now</i>, <i>why</i> often begin a sentence.
They may indicate the writer’s state of mind, his attitude
toward what he is going to say, also the tone, whether of
conviction, remonstrance, surprise, or deliberation, with
which the sentence should be read; as, “<i>Why</i>, let him go
home in the rain, to be sure.”—<i>Jerrold.</i> “<i>Now</i>, the
capitalists were men of understanding and wise in their
generation.”—<i>Bellamy.</i></p>

<p>4. The interjection is an independent element. It may
be a single word or a group of words with the office of
one. Such words and expressions as <i>Ah!</i> <i>Oh!</i> <i>Alas!</i>
<i>Dear me!</i> <i>O my stars and garters!</i> <i>Hurrah!</i> <i>fudge!</i> <i>pooh!</i>
are used to communicate not our thoughts but our feelings.
In doing this they perform the work of a whole
declarative sentence; as,—</p>

    <div class="verse indent10">—<i>Whittier.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The interjection <i>eh?</i> is interrogative. <i>Whoa!</i> and <i>hist!</i>
are imperative. <i>O</i> is frequently used before the noun of
address.</p>



<p><b>The Prepositional Phrase used Independently.</b>—This
is usually a stereotyped phrase ready to hand for any one
who wishes to use it, such a phrase as <i>for example</i>, <i>in fact</i>,
<i>in short</i>, <i>at any rate</i>. In the following sentence from
Stevenson, “I take it, <i>in short</i>, that I was about as near
Nirvana as would be convenient in practical life; and if
this be so I make the Buddhists my sincere compliments,”
the little independent phrase signifies to the reader that
the author, instead of going on with a long description of
his state of feeling, has thought of a happy way by which
he can communicate a knowledge of it in very few words.</p>

<p>In Irving’s sentence, “This, <i>by the way</i>, is a mere
casual remark, which I would not for the universe have it
thought I apply to Governor Van Twiller,” the independent
phrase indicates that this sentence also is only a casual
remark, much like a personal “aside” from the author to
the reader.</p>

<p>In this sentence from Mrs. Gaskell,—“<i>In the first
place</i>, Cranford is in possession of the Amazons,” the
phrase is equivalent to the independent infinitive phrase
<i>to begin with</i>. It informs the reader that the remark it
introduces is necessary as a setting or background for
further description of Cranford.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</span></p>



<p><b>Propositions used Independently.</b>—1. The imperative
sentence addressed to the reader; as, “<i>Mind you</i>, this was
the world as I first knew it.”—<i>Holmes.</i> This independent
element is like a note of warning, telling the reader
not to conclude that this is the world as the writer knew
it later.</p>

<p>2. An exclamation like “Bless your soul!” or “Thank
God!” wherein the subject of the verb is omitted. Such
an expression reveals the author’s feeling about the statement;
as, “The civilized world is learning, <i>thank God</i>,
more and more of the importance of physical science.”—<i>Kingsley.</i></p>

<p>An expression somewhat similar to this is found
in the sentence, “<i>Thanks to you</i>, I am able to speak
French.” Here the cause of my ability to speak French
is given in the expression <i>Thanks to you</i>; but this
is not so constructed as to be a grammatical modifier
of the predicate, and hence must be considered independent.</p>

<p>3. A proposition introduced by <i>as</i>.—This has the
structure of an adverbial clause, but in meaning it is not
a modifier of any part of the sentence. Many of these
expressions are stereotyped; for example, <i>as it were</i>, <i>as it
will be seen</i>, <i>as the case might be</i>, <i>as it was called</i>. They
are usually parenthetical. Their value in the sentence
can best be seen from a few examples.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “Time, <i>as it will be seen afterward</i>, did not allow
Sir George Lewis any chance of making good this prediction.”—<i>McCarthy.</i>
The independent element here
informs the reader that the author will not drop the matter
under discussion with the single statement of it, but will
take it up more at length later.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</span></p>

<p>A similar expression, “as we have seen,” takes the
reader’s mind back to something he has read before.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “The Saxon, <i>as it appears to me</i>, has never shown
any capacity for art.”—<i>Lowell.</i> The independent clause
signifies here that the author makes his statement not as a
matter of fact but only as a matter of personal opinion.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “She was, <i>as I had supposed</i>, a gentlewoman
whom a change of circumstances had brought down from
her high estate.”—<i>Holmes.</i> This independent clause
conveys to the reader the author’s satisfaction in making
a statement that is true and that coincides with his own
supposition.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) “‘You don’t know what your thoughts are going
to be beforehand!’ said the ‘Member of the Haouse,’ <i>as
he called himself</i>.”—<i>Holmes.</i> This independent element
gives the authority for the preceding quotation, and together
with the quotation marks absolves the writer from
all responsibility for spelling and pronunciation.</p>

<p>Familiar forms of this clause are—<i>as everybody says</i>,
<i>as the Bible says</i>, <i>as Shakespeare puts it</i>. We often use
the first of these when we are unwilling ourselves to be
held responsible for our statements. The other two are
sometimes used lest people should think we are trying to
pass off a quoted remark for an original one.</p>

<p>4. A clause of reason introduced by <i>for</i>. When such
a clause is independent, it gives the reason not for any
action expressed in the sentence nor for the whole statement,
but rather the author’s reason for using a particular
word or phrase; as, “The bitterest opponent of the poet
(for like every strong personality he has many enemies)
is thus no less his debtor than his warmest admirer.”—<i>Boyesen.</i>
Such a clause is not always enclosed in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</span>
parenthesis; it is just as often set off by commas or
dashes.</p>

<p>5. An independent proposition, declarative.—Many of
these independent elements are stereotyped; such as, <i>I
dare say</i>, <i>it seems</i>, <i>it is said</i>, <i>it is true</i>. The following
sentences contain familiar instances.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “Mr. Swinburne, <i>Heaven knows</i>, has been imitated
enough.”—<i>Saintsbury.</i> The independent element
here makes the sentence emphatic, even makes it mean
that Mr. Swinburne has been imitated too much.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “To equip so small a book with a preface is, <i>I am
half afraid</i>, to sin against proportion.”—<i>Stevenson.</i> The
independent words are here apologetic, revealing to the
reader the author’s misgiving that the preface is uncalled
for, but not his full conviction.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “I want my ‘asides,’ <i>you see</i>, to whisper loud to
you who read my notes.”—<i>Holmes.</i> The independent
words, a familiar personal remark to the reader, indicate
the author’s appreciation of the fact that the reader understands
fully as well as the author the purpose of the
“asides.”</p>

<p>Sentences like the last three quoted could be re-arranged
so that the independent element would become the principal
proposition and the rest of the sentence a noun clause;
thus, “Heaven knows that Mr. Swinburne has been imitated
enough.” This transposition is unjust, for it makes
a different sentence from what the author intended.
Oftentimes sentences read as if the independent element
were not in the author’s mind when he began to write, but
occurred to him during the writing and so was put in
loosely, parenthetically—for a purpose, to be sure, but
not as part of the structure of the sentence. If we transpose<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</span>
such sentences, we give the independent element an
undue importance, not intended for it by the author.</p>

<p class="c sp">SENTENCE MODIFIERS</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">Closely</span> allied to the independent elements discussed
in the preceding chapter are certain adverbs and adverbial
phrases, which seem to modify not any special part of the
sentence but the whole assertion. In some cases it is
difficult to decide whether it is better to call a certain expression
a sentence modifier or an independent element,
but this need not trouble us greatly, for it is not the name
we give to an element that is the vital point; it is a clear
perception of what that element does in the sentence for
the communication of the author’s thought.</p>



<p><b>Classification of Sentence Modifiers.</b>—Certain of these
modifiers are so clearly distinguishable from all other
sentence-elements that we may study them in the following
groups.</p>

<p>1. Adverbs.—Most of these are modal adverbs, denoting
the manner in which an assertion is made. This may
be positive, doubtful, or negative, hence the adverbs <i>surely</i>,
<i>perhaps</i>, and <i>not</i> are very common sentence modifiers.</p>

<p>Other adverbs make the sentence emphatic, as <i>indeed</i>;
others denote the extent of its application, as <i>generally</i>;
still others take the reader back in thought to some previous
statement, and denote the logical relation between
this previous statement and the sentence in which they
occur, as <i>moreover</i>, <i>however</i>, <i>anyhow</i>, <i>though</i>.</p>

<p>Examples of the use of these adverbs are found in the
following sentences:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</span></p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “<i>Perhaps</i>, Mr. Wilson, you would have the great
kindness to recommence your narrative.”—<i>Conan Doyle.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “<i>Indeed</i>, almost all slang is like parched corn and
should be served up hot or else not at all.”—<i>Higginson.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “It served, <i>moreover</i>, as a council of state to assist
the monarch in the transaction of public business.”—<i>Prescott.</i></p>

<p>2. Prepositional phrases.—These denote, for the most
part, what the modal adverbs denote. Usually they may
be changed to adverbs that are nearly or quite equivalent
in meaning; for example, “on the other hand” = <i>however</i>;
“at all events” = <i>anyhow</i>; “of course” = <i>certainly</i>.</p>

<p>It may seem best to some persons to say of these
phrases, as likewise of the adverbs, that they modify the
predicate instead of the whole sentence. There can be
no objection to this, as the predicate is the asserting part
of the sentence.</p>

<p>Examples of these phrases are found in the following
sentences:</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “<i>For the most part</i>, young people have a pretty
keen sense of honor, so that the main thing is to keep it
fresh and active.”—<i>Munger.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “<i>For my part</i>, I travel not to go anywhere, but to
go.”—<i>Stevenson.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “<i>For the life of me</i>, I cannot understand it.”—<i>Stevenson.</i></p>

<p>3. Phrases or clauses introduced by <i>as</i>; for example,—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) “<i>As luck would have it</i>, there was a fair spring
morning shining over the city.”—<i>Black.</i> This clause
means <i>luckily</i>, and tells the author’s opinion of the statement
he makes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</span></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) “<i>As a rule</i>, we disbelieve all facts and theories for
which we have no use.”—<i>Wm. James.</i> This phrase
means <i>generally</i>, and denotes the extent to which the
statement is true.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) “<i>As sure as my name is Jack Copley</i>, I saw the
prettiest girl in the world today.”—<i>Mrs. Wiggin.</i> This
clause means <i>truly</i>, <i>verily</i>, and is used to make the statement
emphatic.</p>

<p>4. We frequently meet sentences containing a phrase
like that italicized in the following,—“<i>Far from showing
due reverence to St. Edmund</i>, he did not even show
him common justice.”—<i>Carlyle.</i> This phrase, it is
plain, means “<i>instead of showing due reverence to St.
Edmund</i>,” but in addition it implies there is a very wide
difference between two things,—the thing he did not do
and the thing he did do. It would be natural for us to
say—“Instead of white, she wore pink”; and it would
be just as natural to say—“Far from wearing white,
she wore black.” Our choice of phrases depends on the
degree of difference between the two things contrasted.
The difference between white and pink is not great; but
the difference between white and black is one hundred
and eighty degrees.</p>

<p>When we analyze this sentence modifier we find it to
consist of the adverb <i>far</i> for a base-word, modified by a
prepositional phrase introduced by <i>from</i>. The object of
the preposition is a gerund, which may be complete or incomplete,
modified or unmodified.</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for <i>far</i> to be modified by <i>so</i>, which
only intensifies its meaning; thus, “For the King’s subjects,
<i>so far</i> from being charmed by his resolution to
marry a woman out of their midst, are scandalized.”</p>

<p class="c sp">ELLIPTICAL SENTENCES</p>


<p><span class="smcap large">In</span> preceding chapters we have spoken of the tendency
in English speech and composition towards abridgment.
Independent propositions become clauses, clauses become
phrases, and phrases give place to words. This tendency
to abbreviate the expression of thought is due to two<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</span>
causes: (1) a predominating interest in one’s ideas and
a minor interest in the expression. In such a case one
uses only the significant words, leaving out all those that
can be supplied by the reader. (2) A desire to be impressive,
to gain and keep the reader’s attention. At
such times one rejects all unnecessary words as distracting
attention from the main purpose and retarding the
progress of the main thought. The result of either of
these causes is an elliptical sentence—one that cannot be
analyzed without supplying certain elements necessary to
its grammatical structure.</p>

<p>Elliptical sentences are very common. Some of them
have been already mentioned in different chapters, for
instance, the common idiom, “I cannot but think.” Some
other ellipses we shall make the subject of inquiry in the
present chapter, and for convenience we shall take them
up as ellipses in subordinate propositions and ellipses in
principal propositions.</p>

<p>1. An elliptical adjective clause; as,—</p>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“A sound <i>as of myriads singing</i></div>
    <div class="verse indent0">From far and near stole in.”—<i>Whittier.</i></div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>


<p>This ellipsis comes about through the omission of (1) the
correlative of <i>as</i>, which in this case is <i>such</i>, (2) the noun
<i>sound</i>, which can easily be supplied from the principal
proposition, and (3) the verb <i>is</i>. Expanded the sentence
reads,—“Such a sound as a sound of myriads singing
is, from far and near stole in.”</p>

<p>2. The elliptical adverbial clause of time; as, “St.
Patrick, <i>when a boy of twelve</i>, lights a fire with icicles.”—<i>Froude.</i></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</span></p>

<p>In discussing adverbs as modifiers of nouns in Chapter
XXX, we found that an adjective clause is frequently
abridged to an appositive phrase in which the base-word,
or noun in apposition, is modified by an adverb. A sentence
like the following might have arisen in such a way,—“St.
Patrick, <i>then a boy of twelve</i>, lighted a fire with
icicles.” Here we have an abridgment, but it is unnecessary
to supply any ellipsis, for we may say that the adverb
<i>then</i> modifies <i>boy of twelve</i>. But in the sentence quoted
we have not the simple adverb <i>then</i>, but the subordinating
connective <i>when</i>. In order that it may perform its ordinary
and proper function in the sentence, we supply after
it the two words <i>he is</i>, making a regular adverbial clause
of time, <i>when he is a boy of twelve</i>.</p>

<p>3. The elliptical clause of manner; as, “A great city
sprang up <i>as if by magic</i>.” This construction has been
spoken of in the chapter on prepositional phrases. It resembles
the elliptical time clause in that the connective <i>as
if</i> is a subordinating connective and needs a complete
proposition following it. In the sentence quoted we must
therefore supply the words <i>it sprang up</i>.</p>

<p>In the elliptical modal clause the connective is often the
one word <i>as</i>, though it generally has the meaning of <i>as
if</i>; as, “On that I found scratched <i>as with a nail or fork</i>,
the following inscription.”—<i>Holmes</i>.</p>

<p>4. The elliptical adverbial clause of condition.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) An omission of the connective and the subject;
as, “This frame of mind was the great exploit of our
voyage, <i>take it all in all</i>.”—<i>Stevenson.</i> Expanded for
analysis this clause becomes, “<i>if we take it all in all</i>.”</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) An omission of the subject and the verb. This is
found in the familiar expression <i>if possible</i>, which is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</span>
really <i>if it be possible</i>, also in such sentences as the following,—“What
is the use of health and life <i>if not to do
some work with them</i>?”—Here we may supply after <i>if</i>
the words <i>the use is</i> or <i>it is</i>.</p>

<p>5. The elliptical adverbial clause of concession.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) An omission of connective and subject; as, “<i>Do
what we may</i>, summer will have its flies.”—<i>Emerson.</i>
In this sentence the verb <i>do</i> is also to be supplied after the
auxiliary <i>may</i>. Expanded the clause reads, <i>though we
do what we may do</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) An omission of subject and verb, the latter being a
copula; as, “Solitude, <i>though silent as light</i>, is, like
light, the mightiest of agencies; for solitude is essential
to man.”—<i>De Quincey.</i> Since the noun <i>solitude</i> immediately
precedes the clause as subject of the principal
proposition, the clause is perfectly clear without even the
pronoun <i>it</i> for a subject, and the verb <i>is</i> is easily understood.
Only the new and necessary ideas need be expressed
and these are the attribute <i>silent as light</i>. The
base of such an attribute is not always an adjective; it
may be a noun, a participle, or a prepositional phrase.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) An omission of connective and subject, sometimes
also of copula or auxiliary, before a pair of words in opposition
to each other and joined by <i>or</i>; as, “<i>Rain or
shine</i>, the King rode every day for hours.”—<i>Thackeray.</i>
This elliptical expression means “<i>though it might rain or
might shine</i>.”</p>

<p>6. The elliptical adverbial clause consisting of a connective
and a participial phrase. This may denote various
relations,—time, manner, condition, etc., but is so frequent
a construction that it seems best to treat it by itself.
We have already spoken of this construction in the chapter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</span>
on participial phrases, where we gave illustrations
which might be disposed of without supplying any ellipsis.
However, this disposition is not always satisfactory,
and some may prefer to expand the clause in all cases of
this kind. Illustrations are found in the following sentences:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) Denoting time,—“No amount of hereditary
virtue has thus far saved the merely devout communities
from deteriorating, <i>when let alone</i>, into comfort and good
dinners.”—<i>Higginson.</i></p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Denoting manner,—“It blew in enormous sighs,
dying away at regular intervals, <i>as if pausing to draw
breath</i>.”—<i>Hearn.</i></p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Denoting concession,—“Such men, <i>however
pressed with business</i>, are always found capable of doing
a little more.”</p>

<p>7. The elliptical adverbial clause of degree.—This is
so frequent that we seldom find a clause of degree involving
a comparison that is not elliptical. We shall take up
first the ellipses after the conjunction <i>than</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) An omission of the predicate when it is about the
same as the predicate of the principal proposition; as,
“Alas! books cannot be more than the men who write
them (<i>are</i>).”</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) An omission of both subject and verb when these
are readily supplied from the context; as, “In no other
spot had sympathy been more fiercely kindled than along
that Western border where life was always tense with
martial passion.”—<i>J. L. Allen.</i> After <i>than</i> we are to
understand the words <i>it had been kindled</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) An omission of the subject. This may be the impersonal
<i>it</i>; as, “His features were more refined than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</span>
(<i>it</i>) was usual in Roman faces.”—<i>Froude.</i> Or the subject
understood may be the indefinite pronoun <i>what</i>; as,
“We have a great deal more kindness than (<i>what</i>) is
ever spoken.”—<i>Emerson.</i></p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Very much like the last type of sentence is one in
which we cannot supply <i>what</i> but must supply <i>those who</i>,
with the verb <i>are</i> for the predicate of <i>those</i>; as, “He met
more people <i>than could be remembered</i>.” This clause
expanded reads, “<i>than those are who can be remembered</i>.”
This gives us a restrictive adjective clause
within the clause of degree.</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) We find cases of ellipsis after <i>than</i> which it is
difficult to supply, and some of them are familiar everyday
expressions current everywhere and therefore invaluable
in the communication of thought; as, “Naturally
the coming of the Marques de Valdeflores at this critical
juncture was regarded by the colonel as nothing less <i>than
providential</i>.”—<i>Janvier.</i> Shall we make a clause here
reading <i>than a providential thing is</i>?</p>

<p>Another difficult ellipsis is found in the sentence,—“He
may look up to a tower of rock and see its broken
edges, softened by <i>more than three-fourths of a mile</i> of
distance, directly above his eyes.”—<i>King.</i> It seems
best here not to attempt to supply anything, but to take
the italicized words as a unit, as if the one word <i>mile</i> had
been in their place. This sentence could, however, be
expanded to read—<i>softened by more of distance than
three fourths of a mile is</i>.</p>

<p>Another common instance is found in the sentence,—“He
was <i>more than venerated</i> in his day.”—<i>Lord.</i> This
passive construction comes from the active—“We <i>more
than venerated</i> him,” which in turn comes from the sentence,—“We<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</span>
<i>did more than venerate</i> him.” It is possible
to supply the ellipsis in the last sentence, making it,—“We
did more than to venerate him (<i>is much</i>),” but
the other two sentences must be considered idiomatic.</p>

<p>An idiom similar to the last is found in the sentence,—“In
very marked contrast with this younger man is the
<i>something more than middle-aged</i> Register of Deeds.”—<i>Holmes.</i>
The italicized words are a group signifying one
idea, for which we have no single word. The base-word
of the group is <i>more</i>, but this alone is not a modifier of
<i>Register of Deeds</i>. So far as the group of words modifies
the noun phrase <i>Register of Deeds</i>, it cannot be
separated.</p>



<p>We come now to ellipses in clauses of degree after the
conjunction <i>as</i>.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The subject may be omitted; as, “These are by
no means so nearly connected <i>as might be thought at first
sight</i>.”—<i>Bagehot.</i> Here we may supply <i>it</i> after <i>as</i>, or
we may make the clause read “<i>as they might be thought
to be at first sight</i>.”</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The subject and auxiliary of the verb may be
omitted when they can easily be supplied from the principal
proposition; as, “His fellow-conspirators were
hanged nearly as fast <i>as taken</i>.”—<i>Howells.</i> The clause
expanded is “<i>as they were taken</i>.”</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) As after <i>than</i>, so after <i>as</i> we have some idiomatic
expressions arising by ellipsis which it seems best not to
fill out; as, “He knew that into the world where Ramona
really lived he <i>did not so much as enter</i>.”—<i>H. H.</i> This
predicate may be expanded to read <i>did not do so much as
to enter is much</i>, but this is very awkward. Besides, <i>so</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</span>
<i>much as</i> has to us an adverbial force, being almost equivalent
to the adverb <i>even</i>.</p>

<p>An extension of this construction is found in the following
sentence from Hawthorne,—“It was doubtful
whether the poor lady <i>had so much as closed</i> her eyes
during the brief night of midsummer.” The ellipsis could
be supplied if the predicate were <i>had done so much as
close</i>, but as it stands it must be considered an idiom and
left as it is. This construction has even gone over into
the passive voice; as, “Parliament <i>is not so much as mentioned</i>
in the whole instrument.”—<i>Webster.</i></p>

<p>Another familiar elliptical construction is found in the
sentence,—“But you think you <i>may as well have</i> the
right thing for your money.”—<i>Ruskin.</i> If one wishes
he may expand this sentence so that it will read,—“you
may have the right thing for your money as well <i>as you
may not have it</i>.” Here the entire clause is to be supplied.
Sometimes a portion of it is expressed, as in the
sentence,—“You may as well go <i>as not</i>.”</p>

<p>A peculiar expression denoting degree, which it seems
best to give here although it follows neither <i>than</i> nor
<i>as</i> is found in the sentence, He was <i>all but killed</i>. It
seems best not to separate <i>all but</i>, but to consider the expression
as one adverbial modifier of the passive verb <i>was
killed</i>. In the sentence, He was <i>all but dead</i>, we may say
if we choose that <i>all</i> is used as the base-word of the adjective
complement of <i>was</i>, and is modified by the prepositional
phrase <i>but dead</i>. However, the sentence does
not appeal to us in this way; we do not naturally make
the separation between <i>all</i> on one side and <i>but dead</i> on
the other. Still less do we make such a separation when
the word following <i>but</i> is a verb; as in, “We <i>all but</i><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</span>
<i>won</i>.” Instead of this we keep the words <i>all but</i> together
as if they were one word, having almost the same meaning
as the adverb <i>nearly</i>.</p>



<p><b>Ellipses in Principal Propositions.</b>—1. The entire subject
and part of the predicate may be omitted; as, “A
prick (= <i>I gave her a prick</i>) and she passed the most inviting
stable door.”—<i>Stevenson.</i> Here the abbreviated
expression accords well with the thought.</p>

<p>2. If part of a compound sentence is the same as what
has already been expressed, it is frequently omitted; as,
“The former seems to have been a loyal and homely
soul; the latter (<i>seems to have been</i>) restless, imperious,
penetrating, unamiable.”—<i>Morley.</i></p>

<p>3. In replies to questions, that part is often omitted
which can be supplied from the question; as, “‘What do
you hope?’ ‘That long before this moon has grown old,
you will be quite strong again.’”—<i>Miss Mulock.</i> The
reply is here a noun clause, object of <i>hope</i>, which with its
subject <i>I</i> is to be supplied.</p>

<p>4. In sentences beginning with the words <i>no wonder</i>,
the verb <i>is</i> and the anticipative subject <i>it</i> are to be supplied.
The real subject is a noun clause following <i>no
wonder</i>; as, “No wonder the princess loved him.”—<i>Stockton.</i></p>

<p>5. The verb and the anticipative subject <i>it</i> are often
omitted at the beginning of sentences introduced by <i>no
matter</i>; as, “No matter just at this moment, what he
said.”—<i>Holmes.</i> Here the real subject of the predicate
<i>is no matter</i> is the noun clause <i>what he said</i>.</p>

<p>6. Some interrogative or exclamative sentences begin
with the words <i>what if</i>. The word <i>what</i> is all that is left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</span>
of a principal proposition, and <i>if</i> introduces a conditional
clause. It may seem best sometimes to dispose of this if-clause
as a noun clause used as the real subject of the
principal proposition. The principal proposition may be
expanded to read,—“<i>What does it matter</i>,” “<i>what matter
is it</i>,” “<i>what difference does it make</i>,” etc.; as,
“What (<i>would the result be</i>) if one of the Himalayas
could be cloven from its topmost tile of ice to its torrid
base?”—<i>King.</i></p>

<p>7. A construction similar to the last is one in which the
negative adverb <i>not</i> takes the place of a whole proposition;
as, “Not that I could see the boat drift, for I could
not, the stars being all gone by this time.”—<i>S. L.
Clemens.</i> We may expand this sentence to read,—“<i>I
do not mean</i> that I could see,” or “<i>I would not say</i> that I
could see.”</p>

<p>8. Exclamative sentences expressing a wish often begin
with the verb <i>would</i>, which is to be taken as equivalent
to <i>wish</i> with the subject <i>I</i> omitted. <i>Would</i> is followed
by a noun clause used as its object; as, “Would to
Heaven that we had a sieve, that we could so much as
fancy any kind of sieve that would do this work.”</p>

<p>9. The imperative <i>let</i> is sometimes omitted at the beginning
of a sentence, especially before the verb <i>suffice</i>;
as, “<i>Suffice</i> it here to say that the people in all times enjoyed
a freedom far above that possessed by any other
city of Europe.”—<i>Besant.</i></p>

<p class="c xlarge sp">GARNER’S GOVERNMENT<br>
IN THE UNITED STATES</p>

<p class="c sp">By JAMES W. GARNER, Professor of Political Science,<br>
University of Illinois<br>

<span class="more">With Special State Editions</span></p></div>

<div class="bbox1">
<p><span class="dropcap">M</span>ERITS the special consideration of teachers in secondary
schools because in the first place it includes the most
recent governmental problems of interest and importance,
and in the second it devotes an unusual amount of space
to a practical account of the workings of our government.
The treatment, which is simple and interesting, proceeds from
the simple to the most complex, presenting in turn the local,
state, and national forms of government.</p>

<p>¶ The book shows how our governmental system has been
affected by the direct primary movements, the initiative and
referendum, the commission form of municipal government,
and new legislation regarding publicity of campaign expenditure
and corrupt practices at elections. It is, however, the
spirit and actual workings of our government that are emphasized,
rather than its mere mechanism, thus adding to the
interest of the student as well as to the value of the study.</p>

<p>¶ The book is up to date in every respect. Statistics used
are from the latest census. It describes the most recent
changes in the organization and activities of the national, state,
and municipal governments. For example it deals with the
recent reorganization of the federal courts, the establishment
of postal savings banks, the parcels post question, the question
of second class postal rates, primary elections, the new federal
corporation tax, and the income tax amendment.</p>

<p>¶ Unusual attention is devoted to the important subject of
citizenship, and to state and local governments. Wider
reading among students is encouraged by the frequent lists of
references to collateral reading, the documentary or source
materials, the numerous search questions, etc.</p></div>

<p class="c xlarge sp">OUTLINES OF ANCIENT<br>
HISTORY</p>


<p class="c sp">By WILLIAM C. MOREY, Professor of History and<br>
Political Science, University of Rochester</p></div>

<div class="bbox1">
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS course in ancient history, from the earliest times
to Charlemagne, meets fully the requirements of the
College Entrance Examination Board, and of the New
York State Education Department. The same vital features
which have made the author’s Greek History and Roman
History so successful, have been retained in this book. The
same topical method of treatment, the same arrangement by
paragraphs, the same simple, direct style, and the same clear
and graphic presentation, are among its chief characteristics.</p>

<p>¶ The book indicates the historical relations of the various
countries to one another, and the contributions which each
has made to the progress of mankind. Throughout the
author has aimed to develop in the pupil’s mind a scientific
spirit, by emphasizing the continuity of history, and by making
clear the relation of special facts to general movements, the
relation of these general movements to the growth of the
national character and institutions, and the relation of each
nation’s career to the general progress of mankind.</p>

<p>¶ The usual division of ancient history into Oriental, Greek,
and Roman has been followed, and great care has been taken
in each case to lay emphasis on those particular features which
have distinguished one nation from another, and which have
given it the peculiar place it holds in history.</p>

<p>¶ The important relation of geography to history has constantly
been kept in view. More than twenty progressive
maps are given to show the successive changes which took
place in the development and decline of the different nations.
Each chapter is followed by a synopsis for review, while at
the end of the book there is a list of references for reading.</p></div>

<p class="c xlarge sp">NEW MEDIEVAL AND<br>
MODERN HISTORY</p>


<p class="c">From Charlemagne to the Present Day</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>By SAMUEL BANNISTER HARDING, Ph. D., Professor
of European History, Indiana University.</p>

<p>Based upon the author’s “Essentials in Mediaeval and Modern
History,” prepared in consultation with ALBERT
BUSHNELL HART, LL.D., Professor of History,
Harvard University.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="bbox1">
<p><span class="dropcap">W</span>HILE based on the author’s previous Essentials in
Mediaeval and Modern History, in the present volume
the plan has been so reorganized, the scope so
extended, and the matter so largely rewritten, that the result
is practically a new book. The present volume reflects the
suggestions of many teachers who have used the previous work
in their classes. The aim of this book has been to increase the
emphasis on social, industrial, and cultural topics and to enable
the student to understand modern conditions and tendencies.</p>

<p>¶ The narrative is brought fully up-to-date, including such
recent events as the British Parliament Act of 1911, the Italian-Turkish
War, and the Balkan War, 1912-1913. Each topic
is made definite and concrete, and such important subjects as
the unification of Italy and the unification of Germany are
treated in separate chapters.</p>

<p>¶ The teaching apparatus has been made as useful as possible
by the arrangement and the typography of the text and by the
addition of chronological tables, lists of important dates, suggestive
topics and questions for the pupil to investigate, and
brief directions for general reading.</p>

<p>¶ Adequate illustrations and maps are inserted profusely
throughout the text. Variety and color are imparted to the
narrative by frequent quotations from the sources, and by
striking characterizations from modern works.</p></div>

Ph. D., Head of German Department, De Witt Clinton

</div></div>

<div class="bbox1">
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS course reduces to a minimum all preparatory work,
and introduces the learner at the earliest possible moment
to the literature of the language. Among its distinctive
features are:</p>

<p>I. It includes only topics absolutely essential for any
progress whatever, and it presents them as briefly as is consistent
with perfect clearness.</p>

<p>II. It makes large use of “the living grammar.” In this
way it enlivens instruction in grammar, stimulates self-activity,
and develops the feeling for correctness, which is the chief
thing to be looked for in all language study.</p>

<p>III. It lends itself excellently to conversational practice.
The vocabulary has been selected very carefully from everyday
language, and the phrases of the German exercises are
all of a colloquial and strictly idiomatic character. While
primarily intended to illustrate definite grammatical phenomena,
their tone and language are so natural that whole exercises
may be turned into impromptu conversation, thus combining
drill in speaking and in grammar. This is still more true of
the connected readings, which are very simple.</p>

<p>IV. It offers a firm foundation on which a solid superstructure
can be erected. The lessons are steadily progressive;
no attempt is made to minimize difficulties at the beginning.
The English exercises give the pupil a chance to test
his knowledge and power, while the exercises in word formation
stimulate his interest in the building up of his vocabulary,
which will be of great service in future sight reading.</p></div>

<p class="c xlarge sp">FRANÇOIS’ ESSENTIALS<br>
OF FRENCH</p>


<p class="c">By VICTOR E. FRANÇOIS, Ph.D., Associate Professor<br>
of French, College of the City of New York.</p></div>

<div class="bbox1">
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span> COURSE for beginners, whose acquirement of a foreign
language is often hampered by an incomplete mastery
of English grammar. The development here proceeds
from the known English form to the unknown French form,
with constant comparison and contrast of the two languages.
This system will tend to fortify students by forcing them to
notice and analyze the English as well as the French forms
of expression.</p>

<p>¶ The models precede the rules, the salient features being
made prominent by heavy type. The rules cover the necessary
facts of the language as simply and completely as possible,
but the student is not confused by masses of exceptions,
peculiarities, and idioms rarely seen and still more rarely used.
The vocabulary, of moderate extent, is composed of ordinary
words likely to be used in everyday conversation, and is increased
slowly, care being taken to repeat the words again
and again in succeeding exercises.</p>

<p>¶ The first lessons have been made short and simple, in
order to allow for the initial difficulties. The exercises are
composed of sentences connected in sense so far as this is
possible without detriment to the application of the principles
and repetition of words. Each lesson includes generally
four exercises: a review, a portion of French text, a set of
questions based on the text and usually followed by a grammar

ALGEBRA</p>


<p class="c">By WILLIAM J. MILNE, Ph.D., LL.D., President of<br>
the New York State Normal College, Albany, N. Y.</p></div>

<div class="bbox1">
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE Standard Algebra conforms to the most recent
courses of study. The inductive method of presentation
is followed, but declarative statements and observations
are used, instead of questions. Added to this kind of unfolding
and development of the subject are illustrative problems
and explanations to bring out specific points, the whole being
driven home by varied and abundant practice.</p>

<p>¶ The problems are fresh in character, and besides the traditional
problems include a large number drawn from physics,
geometry, and commercial life. They are classified according
to the nature of the equations involved, not according to
subject matter. The statement of necessary definitions and of
principles is clear and concise, but the proofs of principles,
except some important ones, are left for the maturer years of
the pupil.</p>

<p>¶ Accuracy and self-reliance are encouraged by the use of
numerous checks and tests, and by the requirement that results
be verified. The subject of graphs is treated after simple
equations, introduced by some of their simple uses in representing
statistics, and in picturing two related quantities in
the process of change, and again after quadratics. Later they
are utilized in discussing the values of quadratic expressions.
Factoring receives particular attention. Not only are the
usual cases given fully and completely with plenty of practice,
but the factor theorem is taught.</p>

<p>¶ The helpful and frequent reviews are made up of pointed
oral questions, abstract exercises, problems, and recent college
entrance examination questions. The book is unusually handy
in size and convenient for the pocket. The page size is small.</p></div>

<p class="c xlarge sp lsp">PLANT LIFE AND<br>
PLANT USES</p>


<p class="c">By JOHN GAYLORD COULTER, Ph. D.</p></div>

<div class="bbox1">
<p><span class="dropcap">A</span>N elementary textbook providing a foundation for the
study of agriculture, domestic science, or college botany.
But it is more than a textbook on botany—it is a book
about the fundamentals of plant life and about the relations
between plants and man. It presents as fully as is desirable
for required courses in high schools those large facts about
plants which form the present basis of the science of botany.
Yet the treatment has in view preparation for life in general,
and not preparation for any particular kind of calling.</p>

<p>The subject is dealt with from the viewpoint of the pupil
rather than from that of the teacher or the scientist. The
style is simple, clear, and conversational, yet the method is
distinctly scientific, and the book has a cultural as well as
a practical object.</p>

<p>The text has a unity of organization. So far as practicable
the familiar always precedes the unfamiliar in the sequence of
topics, and the facts are made to hang together in order that
the pupil may see relationships. Such topics as forestry, plant
breeding, weeds, plant enemies and diseases, plant culture,
decorative plants, and economic bacteria are discussed where
most pertinent to the general theme rather than in separate
chapters which destroy the continuity. The questions and
suggestions which follow the chapters are of two kinds; some
are designed merely to serve as an aid in the study of the text,
while others suggest outside study and inquiry. The classified
tables of terms which precede the index are intended to serve
the student in review, and to be a general guide to the relative
values of the facts presented. More than 200 attractive illustrations,
many of them original, are included in the book.</p></div>

<p>By GEORGE WILLIAM HUNTER, A. M., Head of
Department of Biology, De Witt Clinton High School,
New York City.</p>
</div></div>

<div class="bbox1">
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS new first-year course treats the subject of biology
as a whole, and meets the requirements of the leading
colleges and associations of science teachers. Instead
of discussing plants, animals, and man as separate forms of
living organisms, it treats of life in a comprehensive manner,
and particularly in its relations to the progress of humanity.
Each main topic is introduced by a problem, which the pupil
is to solve by actual laboratory work. The text that follows
explains and illustrates the meaning of each problem. The
work throughout aims to have a human interest and a practical
value, and to provide the simplest and most easily comprehended
method of demonstration. At the end of each chapter
are lists of references to both elementary and advanced
books for collateral reading.</p></div>

and then tells what materials and apparatus are necessary

to get at the facts when they are found. Following each problem

SCHOOL DICTIONARY</p></div>


<div class="bbox1">
<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>HIS NEW DICTIONARY is based on Webster’s
New International Dictionary, and therefore conforms to
the best present usage. It presents the largest number of
words and phrases ever included in a school dictionary—all
those, however new, likely to be needed by any pupil. It
is a reference book for the reader and a guide in the use of
English, both oral and written. It fills every requirement
that can reasonably be expected of a dictionary of moderate
size.</p>

<p>¶ This new book gives the preference to forms of spelling now
current in the United States, in cases of doubt leaning toward
the simpler forms that may be coming into use. In the matter
of pronunciation such alternatives are included as are in
very common use, but the one that is preferred is clearly indicated.
Each definition is in the form of a specific statement
accompanied by one or more synonyms, between which
careful discrimination is made.</p>

<p>¶ In addition, this dictionary includes an unusual amount of
supplementary information of value to students: the etymology,
syllabication and capitalization of words; many proper
names from folklore, mythology, and the Bible; a list of prefixes
and suffixes; all irregularly inflected forms; rules for
spelling; 2329 lists of synonyms, in which 3518 words are
carefully discriminated; answers to many questions on the use
of correct English constantly asked by pupils; a guide to pronunciation;
abbreviations used in writing and printing; a list
of 1200 foreign words and phrases; a dictionary of 5400
proper names of persons and places, etc.</p></div>
